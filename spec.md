The task is to produce tables that are accessible through AWS Athena, where the table data will be stored in AWS S3.
There are two tables: security_of_interest_pit (where PIT stands for point in time, more on this later) and security_of_interest_latest. These tables will exist in the database 'df_trusted_${env}`.

The data fields will be:
- reference_id: This will be the security_id provided by the user in the REST API, it will be integers that map to a stock ticker.
- business_unit: This will be the team requesting the change (via the REST API). Some examples of business_unit is AE, or CMF
- package_name: This will be a job name, something that the User provides in their request. This is just some string to further group the requests.
- request_date: This will be the date the request was made e.g. 2024-05-16

Both of them will contain the same data. But, unlike security_of_interest_pit, security_of_interest_latest will only contain the latest
(business_unit, package_name) pair when querying via Athena. 

For example: If User wants the following:
```
reference_id(s): [123, 456]
business_unit: AE
package_name: job_1
request_date: [Implicitly calculated to be today]
```
Only to change their mind a few minutes later to only be:
```
reference_id(s): [123]
business_unit: AE
package_name: job_1
request_date: [Implicitly calculated to be today]
```
My Athena queries would return the latest one with only 123 in the reference_id list for that (business_unit, package_name).

The high level "flow" will go as follows:

1) User will interact with our REST API, which will expose a POST endpoint. The user will indicate the business_unit, the package_name, and a list of
reference_id
2) Our REST API will take that payload and write that into S3 so that its available for query in AWS Athena at those tables.

Some other things to note, the business_unit will/must correspond with the user that makes the call, they refer to the team they belong to. So only a user who is part of the AE team can make a call associated with the business_unit so im not sure if this is better in the endpoint URL or as part of the payload.

Each business_unit will probably have thousands of package_name and there may be hundreds of reference_id per package_name, so i imagine there will be millions of rows.

While business_units must already exist (e.g. AE is an existing business_unit so its valid but XYZ isn't and would fail), this endpoint would be responsible for creating new package_name and the package_name will contain some list of reference_ids.

To start: How would you design the endpoint? The endpoint should be robust and should be able to accept multiple package_names, and each package_name should support multiple reference_ids

I want something that is stable for the long-term that is extendable, and generalizable

Okay, let's break down the design for the API endpoint, S3 storage, and Athena tables.

**1. API Endpoint Design**

Given the requirements (robust, extendable, generalizable, handling multiple packages, associating `business_unit` with the user), here's a proposed design:

*   **Method:** `POST` - This is appropriate as the user is submitting a new state or "event" for one or more packages.
*   **URL Structure:** `/api/v1/security-of-interest/{business_unit}`
    *   Using `business_unit` as a path parameter makes sense for several reasons:
        *   It clearly defines the scope of the resource being affected.
        *   It facilitates authorization: You can easily check if the authenticated user making the call belongs to the `{business_unit}` specified in the path *before* processing the payload.
        *   It aligns with REST principles where the path identifies the resource hierarchy.
*   **Authentication/Authorization:** Use AWS IAM, Cognito, or a similar mechanism. The API Gateway (or the backend service) needs to:
    1.  Authenticate the user.
    2.  Determine the user's associated `business_unit`(s).
    3.  Verify that the `business_unit` in the URL path matches (or is one of) the user's allowed units. If not, return `403 Forbidden`.
    4.  Verify that the `business_unit` in the path is a valid, existing unit. If not, return `404 Not Found` or `400 Bad Request`.
*   **Request Body:** A JSON array of objects, where each object represents a package and its associated securities. This allows submitting updates for multiple packages in a single call.

    ```json
    // POST /api/v1/security-of-interest/AE
    [
      {
        "package_name": "job_1",
        "reference_ids": [123]
      },
      {
        "package_name": "critical_daily_report",
        "reference_ids": [789, 1011, 1213]
      }
      // ... more package objects if needed
    ]
    ```

*   **Request Body Validation:**
    *   The body must be a non-empty JSON array.
    *   Each object in the array must contain:
        *   `package_name`: String, non-empty. Define reasonable length limits and allowed characters if necessary.
        *   `reference_ids`: Array of integers, must contain at least one integer. Ensure they are actual integers.
*   **Response Codes:**
    *   `202 Accepted`: The request is valid and has been accepted for processing (S3 write might happen asynchronously). You could return a request ID for tracking.
    *   `400 Bad Request`: Invalid JSON, missing fields, empty arrays, invalid data types (`reference_ids` not integers, etc.), invalid `business_unit` format (if checked here instead of 404).
    *   `401 Unauthorized`: User is not authenticated.
    *   `403 Forbidden`: User is authenticated but not authorized to submit for the specified `business_unit`.
    *   `404 Not Found`: The specified `business_unit` does not exist in your system.
    *   `500 Internal Server Error`: Backend processing error (e.g., failed to write to S3).

**2. S3 Storage Design**

To support both PIT and Latest views efficiently in Athena, we need a well-structured and partitioned layout.

*   **Bucket:** Choose a suitable S3 bucket, e.g., `s3://your-company-datalake-${env}/`
*   **Base Path:** `trusted/security-of-interest/` (Using 'trusted' implies some level of cleansing/validation has occurred).
*   **File Format:** **Parquet**. This is crucial for Athena performance and cost-effectiveness. It's columnar, supports compression (Snappy or Gzip), and handles schema evolution.
*   **Partitioning Strategy:** Partitioning is key to pruning data scanned by Athena, especially for the `_latest` view logic and time-based queries on `_pit`.
    *   **Primary Partition:** `business_unit` - This aligns with the API structure and likely query patterns.
    *   **Secondary Partitions:** Date-based - `year`, `month`, `day`. This allows efficient time-series analysis on the `_pit` table and helps isolate data for potential reprocessing or management.
    *   **Example S3 Object Path:**
        `s3://your-company-datalake-${env}/trusted/security-of-interest/business_unit=AE/year=2024/month=05/day=16/some-unique-id-part-00000.parquet`
*   **Data Structure within Parquet Files:** Each row in the Parquet file will represent *one complete submission event* for a specific `(business_unit, package_name)` pair at a point in time.

    *   `package_name`: STRING
    *   `reference_ids`: ARRAY<INT> (Storing the list directly as an array is efficient for retrieval).
    *   `event_timestamp`: TIMESTAMP (Crucial! Use a high-precision timestamp, e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.sss`, generated server-side when the request is processed. This is needed to determine the *absolute latest* record if multiple updates occur on the same day).
    *   `request_date`: DATE (Can be derived from `event_timestamp`, useful for partitioning and simple date filtering, store as YYYY-MM-DD).
    *   *(Optional but Recommended):* `request_id` (STRING - link back to the API request), `user_id` (STRING - who made the request).

*   **How Data is Written:**
    1.  When the API receives a request like the example above for `business_unit=AE`:
    2.  It generates a precise `event_timestamp` (e.g., `2024-05-16 10:30:05.123`).
    3.  It extracts the `request_date` (`2024-05-16`).
    4.  It creates *two* records (because the request had two package objects):
        *   Record 1: `package_name="job_1"`, `reference_ids=[123]`, `event_timestamp="2024-05-16 10:30:05.123"`, `request_date="2024-05-16"`
        *   Record 2: `package_name="critical_daily_report"`, `reference_ids=[789, 1011, 1213]`, `event_timestamp="2024-05-16 10:30:05.123"`, `request_date="2024-05-16"`
    5.  These records are written to a Parquet file (or multiple files if the payload is huge) in the corresponding S3 partition: `s3://.../business_unit=AE/year=2024/month=05/day=16/`

**3. Athena Table Definitions**

In the `df_trusted_${env}` database:

*   **Table 1: `security_of_interest_pit` (Point-In-Time)**
    *   This table directly maps to the S3 data and shows all historical records.
    *   Type: External Table

    ```sql
    CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE `df_trusted_${env}`.`security_of_interest_pit`(
      `package_name` string,
      `reference_ids` array<int>,
      `event_timestamp` timestamp,
      `request_date` date -- Or string if preferred, matches data type in Parquet
      -- Optional: `request_id` string, `user_id` string
      )
    PARTITIONED BY (
      `business_unit` string,
      `year` string,
      `month` string,
      `day` string)
    ROW FORMAT SERDE
      'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.serde.ParquetHiveSerDe'
    STORED AS INPUTFORMAT
      'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.MapredParquetInputFormat'
    OUTPUTFORMAT
      'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.MapredParquetOutputFormat'
    LOCATION
      's3://your-company-datalake-${env}/trusted/security-of-interest/'
    TBLPROPERTIES (
      'parquet.compression'='SNAPPY', -- Or GZIP
      'classification'='parquet'
    );
    ```
    *   **Partition Management:** You need a way to add new partitions as data arrives daily. Options:
        *   **AWS Glue Crawler:** Schedule a crawler to run periodically (e.g., hourly or daily) to detect and add new partitions.
        *   **`MSCK REPAIR TABLE df_trusted_${env}.security_of_interest_pit;`:** Run this command manually or via a scheduled Lambda/Step Function after data is written.
        *   **Event-Driven:** S3 Event Notification -> Lambda -> `ALTER TABLE ADD PARTITION` command (most immediate, slightly more complex setup).

*   **Table 2: `security_of_interest_latest`**
    *   This table provides a view showing only the most recent record for each `(business_unit, package_name)` combination.
    *   Type: **Athena View** (This avoids data duplication and computes the latest state on the fly)

    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `df_trusted_${env}`.`security_of_interest_latest` AS
    SELECT
      package_name,
      reference_ids,
      event_timestamp,
      request_date,
      business_unit -- Important to include partition columns in the view output
    FROM (
      SELECT
        pit.package_name,
        pit.reference_ids,
        pit.event_timestamp,
        pit.request_date,
        pit.business_unit, -- Select partition columns from the source table
        -- Assign a rank to each record within a BU/Package group, ordered by time DESC
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
          PARTITION BY pit.business_unit, pit.package_name
          ORDER BY pit.event_timestamp DESC
        ) as rn
      FROM
        `df_trusted_${env}`.`security_of_interest_pit` pit
    ) ranked_pit
    WHERE
      rn = 1; -- Select only the latest record (rank=1) for each group
    ```

    *   **How it works:** The `ROW_NUMBER()` window function assigns a rank to each record within the partition defined by `business_unit` and `package_name`. The `ORDER BY event_timestamp DESC` ensures the most recent record gets rank 1. The outer query filters for `rn = 1`.
    *   **Performance:** When you query the `security_of_interest_latest` view with a filter like `WHERE business_unit = 'AE'`, Athena is smart enough to push down the predicate to the underlying `security_of_interest_pit` table, utilizing the S3 partitioning to scan only the data for `business_unit=AE`. It will still need to scan all historical data *within* that partition (across all dates) to find the latest `event_timestamp` for each `package_name` within that business unit, but this is generally efficient enough, especially with Parquet.

**Summary of Flow:**

1.  User POSTs to `/api/v1/security-of-interest/{business_unit}` with `[{"package_name": "p1", "reference_ids": [...]}, ...]`.
2.  API authenticates/authorizes user against `{business_unit}`.
3.  API validates the payload.
4.  API generates `event_timestamp`, determines `request_date`, `year`, `month`, `day`.
5.  For *each* object in the payload array, API prepares a record (`package_name`, `reference_ids`, `event_timestamp`, `request_date`).
6.  API writes these records into one or more Parquet files in the correct S3 partition (`s3://.../business_unit=.../year=.../month=.../day=.../`).
7.  Partition discovery mechanism (Crawler, MSCK REPAIR, Lambda) updates the `security_of_interest_pit` table's partitions.
8.  Users can query `security_of_interest_pit` for full history or `security_of_interest_latest` for the current state via Athena.

This design provides a clear separation of concerns, leverages efficient storage (Parquet) and querying (Partitioning, Views), and creates a maintainable and extendable system.

Okay, let's break down the "Athena Table Definitions" section in more detail, assuming little prior AWS/Athena knowledge.

**What is AWS Athena?**

Imagine you have a massive amount of data stored in files within AWS S3 (which is like a giant, highly durable online file storage system). You want to ask questions of this data using standard SQL (Structured Query Language), just like you would with a traditional database.

Athena is a service that lets you do exactly that. It's "serverless," meaning you don't manage any servers or databases yourself. You simply:

1.  **Tell Athena *where* your data files are in S3.**
2.  **Tell Athena *what* the data looks like (the structure or "schema").**
3.  **Write standard SQL queries.**

Athena reads the data *directly* from S3 when you run a query, processes it, and gives you the results. You only pay for the amount of data scanned by your queries.

**What is an Athena "Database"?**

In Athena (like in many SQL systems), a "database" is just a logical container or namespace to organize your tables. It helps you group related tables together.

*   `df_trusted_${env}`: This name you've chosen suggests:
    *   `df`: Maybe stands for Data Foundation or Data Framework? (Just a guess)
    *   `trusted`: Implies the data in this database has gone through some level of validation or cleansing, making it reliable for use (as opposed to maybe a "raw" or "staging" database).
    *   `${env}`: This is a placeholder (like `dev`, `staging`, `prod`) to separate tables for different deployment environments. So you might have `df_trusted_dev`, `df_trusted_prod`, etc.

Creating a database is simple, usually a one-time command like `CREATE DATABASE df_trusted_dev;`.

**What is an Athena "Table"?**

This is the crucial part. An Athena table is **NOT** like a traditional database table that *stores* the data itself. Instead, an Athena table is primarily **metadata**. It's a definition stored in Athena that tells it:

1.  **Schema:** What are the column names and their data types (e.g., `package_name` is a string, `reference_ids` is an array of integers)?
2.  **Location:** Which specific folder(s) in S3 contain the data files for this table?
3.  **Format:** How is the data stored within those files (e.g., Parquet, JSON, CSV)?
4.  **Partitioning (Optional but important):** How is the data organized into subfolders within the main S3 location? This is key for performance and cost.

**Table 1: `security_of_interest_pit` (Point-In-Time) - The Base Table**

*   **Purpose:** To represent *every single record* ever written by your API. If `AE`/`job_1` was updated 5 times, this table will have all 5 entries, allowing you to see the history.
*   **Type: `EXTERNAL TABLE`**: This keyword explicitly tells Athena, "The data for this table lives *outside* of Athena, in an external location (S3)." This is standard for data lakes built on S3.

Let's break down the `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` SQL command step-by-step:

```sql
-- 1. Command to create a table that points to external data
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE `df_trusted_${env}`.`security_of_interest_pit`(
  -- 2. Define the columns and their data types
  `package_name` string,           -- The package name provided by the user
  `reference_ids` array<int>,     -- The list of security IDs (stored as an array/list of integers)
  `event_timestamp` timestamp,     -- The exact server-side timestamp when the event was processed (for finding the absolute latest)
  `request_date` date             -- The date the request was made (useful for simple filtering)
  -- Optional: `request_id` string, `user_id` string -- Could add more tracking info here
)
-- 3. Define how the data is partitioned in S3
PARTITIONED BY (
  `business_unit` string,         -- Data is in folders like 'business_unit=AE', 'business_unit=CMF'
  `year` string,                  -- Within those, folders like 'year=2024'
  `month` string,                 -- Within those, 'month=05'
  `day` string                    -- Within those, 'day=16'
)
-- Note: We use 'string' for partition columns for simplicity, even for year/month/day.
--       Athena understands how to filter these string-based partitions effectively.

-- 4. Specify the data format and the library (SerDe) to read/write it
ROW FORMAT SERDE
  'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.serde.ParquetHiveSerDe'
-- This tells Athena to use the Parquet Serializer/Deserializer (SerDe).
-- Think of a SerDe as a translator between Athena's SQL engine and the specific file format (Parquet in this case).

-- 5. Define the Input/Output formats (technical requirement for Parquet in Hive DDL)
STORED AS INPUTFORMAT
  'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.MapredParquetInputFormat'
OUTPUTFORMAT
  'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.parquet.MapredParquetOutputFormat'
-- These lines are standard boilerplate when using Parquet format.

-- 6. Specify the BASE S3 location where all data for this table resides
LOCATION
  's3://your-company-datalake-${env}/trusted/security-of-interest/'
-- Athena combines this base LOCATION with the PARTITIONED BY info.
-- When you query WHERE business_unit='AE' AND year='2024' AND month='05' AND day='16',
-- Athena knows to look *only* inside the 's3://.../business_unit=AE/year=2024/month=05/day=16/' folder.

-- 7. Optional table properties
TBLPROPERTIES (
  'parquet.compression'='SNAPPY', -- Tells Athena (and potentially writers) that the Parquet files use SNAPPY compression (fast and efficient). Could also be GZIP.
  'classification'='parquet'      -- A hint for other AWS services like Glue Crawler about the data format.
);
```

**Partitioning Explained:**

*   **Why Partition?** Imagine you have years of data. If you query for data from `AE` on `2024-05-16`, without partitioning, Athena would have to scan *every single file* in the `s3://.../security-of-interest/` directory to find the relevant records. This is slow and expensive (you pay per byte scanned).
*   **How it Works:** By partitioning, we physically organize the data in S3 into subfolders based on column values (`business_unit`, `year`, `month`, `day`). The `PARTITIONED BY` clause in the `CREATE TABLE` statement tells Athena about this folder structure.
*   **Benefit:** When you run a query with a `WHERE` clause that filters on partition columns (e.g., `WHERE business_unit = 'AE' AND year = '2024'`), Athena uses the table definition to figure out the exact S3 folder path (like `.../business_unit=AE/year=2024/`) and *only* scans the files within that specific folder (and its relevant subfolders like `month=05/day=16/`). This drastically reduces the amount of data scanned, making queries faster and cheaper.

**Partition Management (The Catch!)**

Athena needs to know *which specific partitions (folders) exist*. Just creating the folders in S3 isn't enough. When new data arrives (e.g., for `2024-05-17`), you need to tell Athena that the partition `business_unit=AE/year=2024/month=05/day=17/` now exists and should be considered part of the `security_of_interest_pit` table. You have a few options:

1.  **AWS Glue Crawler:** This is an AWS service you can schedule (e.g., run once a day). It scans your S3 location (`s3://.../security-of-interest/`), detects any new folders (partitions) that match the table's structure, and automatically updates Athena's table metadata. **This is often the recommended approach for automated partition management.**
2.  **`MSCK REPAIR TABLE` Command:** You can manually run the SQL command `MSCK REPAIR TABLE df_trusted_${env}.security_of_interest_pit;` in the Athena query editor (or via a script). This command tells Athena to scan the base S3 location for the table and add metadata for any partitions it finds that aren't already registered. Simpler for infrequent updates or manual processes.
3.  **Event-Driven (Lambda):** A more advanced setup where an S3 event (when a new file is written) triggers an AWS Lambda function, which then runs an `ALTER TABLE ADD PARTITION ...` command to add the specific new partition metadata immediately. Faster, but more complex to build.

**Table 2: `security_of_interest_latest` - The View**

*   **Purpose:** To show *only the most recent* entry for each unique combination of `business_unit` and `package_name`, based on the `event_timestamp`.
*   **Type: `VIEW`**: A view is essentially a saved SQL query that acts like a virtual table. It doesn't store any data itself. When you query the view, Athena runs the underlying query against the base table (`security_of_interest_pit`) and returns the results.
*   **Benefit:** You don't duplicate data. The "latest" logic is calculated dynamically whenever you query the view.

Let's break down the `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` SQL command:

```sql
-- 1. Command to create (or replace if it exists) a view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW `df_trusted_${env}`.`security_of_interest_latest` AS
-- 2. The SELECT query that defines what the view returns
SELECT
  -- 3. Select the columns you want in the final "latest" view
  package_name,
  reference_ids,
  event_timestamp, -- The timestamp of the latest event
  request_date,    -- The request date of the latest event
  business_unit    -- Include the partition column used in the grouping/ranking
FROM (
    -- 4. This is an inner query (subquery) that does the hard work of finding the latest record
    SELECT
      pit.package_name,
      pit.reference_ids,
      pit.event_timestamp,
      pit.request_date,

      -- 5. The magic: ROW_NUMBER() Window Function

  rn = 1; -- Since we ordered by timestamp DESC, rn=1 represents the latest record for each group.
```

**How the `_latest` View Works:**

1.  **Inner Query:** It looks at the *entire history* (`security_of_interest_pit`).
2.  **`ROW_NUMBER() OVER(...)`:** This is a powerful "window function."
    *   `PARTITION BY pit.business_unit, pit.package_name`: It conceptually groups all rows that have the same `business_unit` and `package_name` together.
    *   `ORDER BY pit.event_timestamp DESC`: Within each group, it sorts the rows based on the `event_timestamp`, putting the most recent one first.
    *   `ROW_NUMBER()`: It then assigns a rank (1, 2, 3, ...) to each row within its group based on that sorted order. The newest record gets rank 1, the second newest gets rank 2, and so on.
3.  **Outer Query:** It takes the result of the inner query (which now includes the rank `rn`).
4.  **`WHERE rn = 1`:** It filters these results, keeping *only* the rows that received rank 1 (the latest record for each `business_unit`/`package_name` combination).

**In essence:**

*   `security_of_interest_pit` is the **source of truth**, defined directly over the partitioned S3 data files.
*   `security_of_interest_latest` is a **convenient, dynamic lens** that uses a SQL query (saved as a view) to show only the current state derived from that source of truth.

When you query `security_of_interest_latest`, Athena cleverly combines the view's query with your query. If you add `WHERE business_unit = 'AE'`, Athena can often push that filter down to the `security_of_interest_pit` table scan, still leveraging the S3 partitioning for efficiency.

Okay, let's clarify how the `security_of_interest_latest` view works and answer your question directly.

**The View is NOT a Snapshot, It's a Saved Query Recipe**

Think of the `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW security_of_interest_latest AS ...` command like saving a complex search filter or a recipe in a cookbook.

*   **The Cookbook:** Your Athena database (`df_trusted_${env}`).
*   **The Ingredients:** The data stored in S3, represented by the base table `security_of_interest_pit`. This table knows where *all* the historical data files are.
*   **The Recipe (`security_of_interest_latest` view):** The SQL query you saved using `CREATE VIEW`. This recipe specifically says:
    1.  "Look at *all* the ingredients (all rows in `security_of_interest_pit`)."
    2.  "Group them by `business_unit` and `package_name`."
    3.  "Within each group, find the one with the most recent `event_timestamp`."
    4.  "Show me only that most recent one for each group."

**You Do NOT Need to Re-run the View Definition**

You only run the `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW ...` command **once** (or again only if you need to *change the logic* of how "latest" is defined).

**How Querying the View Works:**

When you run a query like this:

```sql
SELECT reference_ids
FROM df_trusted_${env}.security_of_interest_latest
WHERE business_unit = 'AE'
  AND package_name = 'job_1';
```

Here's what Athena does behind the scenes *every time you run this query*:

1.  **Looks up the View:** Athena sees you're querying `security_of_interest_latest`. It knows this isn't a real table holding data, but a view (a saved query/recipe).
2.  **Retrieves the Recipe:** It retrieves the stored SQL definition of the view (the complex query with `ROW_NUMBER()` we defined earlier).
3.  **Combines Queries:** It effectively substitutes the view's definition into your query. It also intelligently combines your `WHERE` clause (`business_unit = 'AE' AND package_name = 'job_1'`) with the view's logic.
4.  **Optimizes:** Athena's query planner analyzes the combined query. Crucially, it sees the filter `business_unit = 'AE'` and knows that the underlying `security_of_interest_pit` table is partitioned by `business_unit`. It will push this filter down.
5.  **Executes Against Base Table:** Athena runs the combined, optimized query against the `security_of_interest_pit` table.
    *   Because of partitioning and the pushed-down filter, it **only scans the S3 data** located in the `s3://.../business_unit=AE/` partitions.
    *   It reads the data for `package_name = 'job_1'` within those AE partitions.
    *   It applies the `ROW_NUMBER()` logic *to the data it just read* to find the row with the maximum `event_timestamp` for that specific package (`job_1` in `AE`).
    *   It filters to keep only the row where the calculated rank (`rn`) is 1.
6.  **Returns Results:** It returns the `reference_ids` from that single, latest row it found.

**In Simple Terms:**

Querying the view is like asking Athena: "Please execute the 'find the latest' recipe right now, using the current ingredients in the `pit` table, but only focus on the ingredients for 'AE' and 'job_1'."

**Key Takeaway:**

The view is **dynamic**. It doesn't store any data itself. Every time you query the view, it re-runs its underlying logic against the **current data** present in the `security_of_interest_pit` table (which points to your S3 files). So, if new data for `AE`/`job_1` arrived in S3 just seconds ago (and the partitions were updated), querying the view *now* will reflect that latest data automatically. You just run your simple `SELECT ... FROM security_of_interest_latest WHERE ...` query whenever you need the current state.

Okay, let's analyze the performance characteristics of using an Athena View with `ROW_NUMBER()` for your `security_of_interest_latest` use case, considering millions of rows.

**Short Answer:**

For your *most common and critical* query pattern – filtering by `business_unit` (e.g., `WHERE business_unit = 'AE'`) – the view approach should be **reasonably performant**, likely completing in seconds to perhaps low minutes, even with millions of rows *in total*. Performance depends heavily on how much data exists *within the specific partition(s)* being queried. Querying without filters will be slow.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

1.  **The Power of Partition Pruning:**
    *   This is the **most important factor**. Your `security_of_interest_pit` table is partitioned by `business_unit`, `year`, `month`, `day`.
    *   When you query the `security_of_interest_latest` view with a filter like `WHERE business_unit = 'AE'`, Athena is smart enough to apply this filter *before* scanning S3 data.
    *   It will **only scan the data** located under the `s3://.../business_unit=AE/` prefix in your S3 bucket. It completely ignores data for `CMF`, `XYZ`, etc.
    *   This dramatically reduces the amount of data Athena needs to read and process. If 'AE' accounts for 10% of your total data, the query instantly becomes roughly 10x faster than scanning everything.

2.  **Efficient Data Format (Parquet):**
    *   You're planning to use Parquet. This is excellent for Athena. Parquet is columnar, meaning Athena only needs to read the specific columns required by the query from S3.
    *   For the view's underlying `ROW_NUMBER()` calculation, it primarily needs `business_unit`, `package_name`, and `event_timestamp`. For the final result, it reads the columns you `SELECT` (e.g., `reference_ids`).
    *   It avoids reading large `reference_ids` arrays for rows that aren't the latest or don't match the final `SELECT`, saving significant I/O and processing time compared to row-based formats like JSON or CSV.
    *   Compression (like SNAPPY) further reduces the amount of data transferred from S3.

3.  **The Cost of the Window Function (`ROW_NUMBER()`):**
    *   While partition pruning limits the *input data*, the `ROW_NUMBER()` function still needs to process all the rows *within the scanned partitions* to find the latest `event_timestamp` for each `package_name`.
    *   This involves sorting or hashing the data based on the `PARTITION BY` (`business_unit`, `package_name`) and `ORDER BY` (`event_timestamp DESC`) clauses within Athena's execution engine.
    *   **This is the main computational overhead.** If a single `business_unit` (like 'AE') has millions of historical records across thousands of `package_name`s spanning years, this step will take time. However, Athena is designed to handle large datasets and perform such operations distributedly.

4.  **Impact of Filters:**
    *   `WHERE business_unit = 'AE'`: **Highly effective.** Reduces S3 scan via partition pruning.
    *   `WHERE business_unit = 'AE' AND package_name = 'job_1'`: **Still benefits hugely from `business_unit` partitioning.** The `package_name` filter helps reduce the *output* after the `ROW_NUMBER()` calculation, but doesn't significantly reduce the initial data scan or the window function's workload compared to filtering by `business_unit` alone (since `package_name` is not a partition key). The performance will be very similar to just filtering by `business_unit`.
    *   `WHERE business_unit = 'AE' AND request_date > '...'`: **Effective.** Leverages date partitioning (`year`, `month`, `day`) *in addition* to `business_unit` partitioning, further reducing the scan scope. *However*, finding the absolute latest might still require looking back further than the date filter unless you are certain the latest record falls within that date range. The `ROW_NUMBER()` still needs to consider all relevant history for the `business_unit` partition to guarantee correctness for the "latest" logic.
    *   `SELECT * FROM security_of_interest_latest;` (No filters): **Potentially very slow and expensive.** Athena would have to scan *all* partitions and process the `ROW_NUMBER()` function across the entire dataset. Avoid this if possible on large tables.

5.  **Data Volume per Partition:**
    *   Millions of rows *in total* is generally fine.
    *   Performance becomes more dependent on the number of rows *per partition being queried*. If one `business_unit` has tens or hundreds of millions of historical rows, queries filtered to that unit will naturally take longer than one with only thousands.

**Potential Issues and Mitigations:**

*   **Small File Problem:** If your API writes very frequent, small Parquet files, this can slow down Athena (overhead in listing/opening many files). Implement a compaction strategy:
    *   Use Kinesis Data Firehose to buffer data and write larger files.
    *   Run a periodic AWS Glue ETL job or Lambda function to merge small files into larger ones (e.g., once per day). Target file sizes between 128MB and 1GB.
*   **Very High Data Volume within a Partition:** If queries for a specific `business_unit` become too slow (e.g., consistently taking many minutes) due to immense historical data for that unit, you *could* consider:
    *   **Materialization:** Create a *separate physical table* (not a view) that stores *only* the latest state. An ETL job (e.g., daily Glue job) would run the `ROW_NUMBER()` logic on the `pit` table and overwrite this "materialized latest" table. Queries against this table would be extremely fast (just reading the pre-calculated state), but the data would only be as fresh as the last ETL run. This adds complexity and infrastructure cost.

**Conclusion:**

For typical queries filtered by `business_unit`, the Athena view using `ROW_NUMBER()` over a partitioned Parquet dataset is a standard and generally **performant pattern**, even with millions of rows overall. Expect query times in the seconds to low minutes range. Ensure you manage file sizes (avoid too many small files) and rely heavily on the `business_unit` partition filter in your queries. Avoid querying the view without filters on large datasets.

Okay, this clarifies the priority. You need good performance for specific `(business_unit, package_name)` lookups on the `_latest` view *during the current day*, even if those lookups aren't constant.

Given this, the **Buffering/Batching approach (using Kinesis Data Firehose) is the strongly recommended solution.**

Here's why the "1 API Call -> 1 File + Daily Compaction" model falls short for *your specific need*:

1.  **Intra-day Small File Problem:** When you query for `AE`/`job_1` at, say, 2 PM on Tuesday, the `_latest` view needs to look at the `security_of_interest_pit` data for Tuesday. With the compaction model, the Tuesday partition (`.../day=Tuesday/`) will contain potentially hundreds or thousands of small files generated by every API call made for `AE` since midnight.
2.  **Athena Overhead:** Even though you only want the latest for `job_1`, Athena first needs to identify all files in the `.../business_unit=AE/.../day=Tuesday/` partition. It then has to open many of these small files to find the relevant records for `job_1` and determine which one has the highest `event_timestamp`. This process of listing and opening many small files is inherently slow in Athena and will likely not meet your definition of "good performance," even if the final result is small.
3.  **Compaction Doesn't Help Intra-day:** The daily compaction job will optimize Tuesday's data *tonight*, making queries for Tuesday fast *tomorrow*. It doesn't help performance *during* Tuesday.

**Why Kinesis Data Firehose (or similar batching) is Better Here:**

1.  **Optimized Files from the Start:** Firehose buffers the records sent by your API (e.g., for 5-15 minutes or until 64-128MB accumulates). It then writes these buffered records as a single, larger Parquet file to the correct S3 partition (`.../business_unit=AE/.../day=Tuesday/`).
2.  **Reduced File Count:** Instead of thousands of tiny files accumulating during the day, you'll have far fewer, larger files (e.g., one new file every 5-15 minutes).
3.  **Faster Athena Scans:** When you query for `AE`/`job_1` at 2 PM, Athena still scans the `.../business_unit=AE/.../day=Tuesday/` partition, but it only needs to list and open a handful of larger files. This significantly reduces the overhead.
4.  **Good Intra-day Performance:** While the `ROW_NUMBER()` calculation still needs to happen, the dominant bottleneck (dealing with excessive small files) is removed. This should provide the good intra-day query performance you need for those specific lookups.

**Implementation Sketch with Firehose:**

1.  **API:** Receives `POST /api/v1/security-of-interest/AE` with `[{"package_name": "job_1", "reference_ids": [123]}]`.
2.  **API Processing:**
    *   Validates request.
    *   Generates `event_timestamp`.
    *   Constructs a JSON record (or multiple records if the request has multiple packages):
        ```json
        {
          "business_unit": "AE",
          "package_name": "job_1",
          "reference_ids": [123],
          "event_timestamp": "2024-05-17T14:05:10.123Z", // ISO 8601 format often good
          "request_date": "2024-05-17"
          // Derive partitioning fields year, month, day if needed for Firehose partitioning
          "partition_year": "2024",
          "partition_month": "05",
          "partition_day": "17"
        }
        ```
3.  **API Sends to Firehose:** Uses AWS SDK's `PutRecordBatch` API call to send the record(s) to your configured Firehose Delivery Stream.
4.  **Firehose Configuration:**
    *   **Source:** Direct PUT (from your API).
    *   **Data Transformation:** Enabled (optional, but recommended for schema enforcement/minor cleanup via a Lambda function if needed).
    *   **Record Format Conversion:** Enabled. Convert source JSON to **Parquet**. Specify the schema.
    *   **Destination:** S3 Bucket (`s3://your-company-datalake-${env}/trusted/security-of-interest/`).
    *   **S3 Buffering:** Configure hints (e.g., buffer size 128 MiB, buffer interval 300 seconds - adjust based on expected volume).
    *   **Dynamic Partitioning:** Enabled. Use inline parsing to extract values from the JSON records to create the S3 prefix: `partitionPrefix=business_unit=!{partitionKeyFromQuery:business_unit}/year=!{partitionKeyFromQuery:partition_year}/month=!{partitionKeyFromQuery:partition_month}/day=!{partitionKeyFromQuery:partition_day}/` (Note: `!{partitionKeyFromQuery:...}` tells Firehose to get values from the record data).
    *   **S3 Compression:** `SNAPPY` (or GZIP).
5.  **Athena:** Your `security_of_interest_pit` table definition and `security_of_interest_latest` view remain the same. Use a Glue Crawler or `MSCK REPAIR TABLE` to update partitions (though Firehose creating files should trigger event notifications you could potentially use for more real-time partition adds if needed).

This setup directly addresses your need for good performance on current-day data for specific lookups by preventing the small file problem from occurring in the first place.
