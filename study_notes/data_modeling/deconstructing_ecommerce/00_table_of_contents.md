### The Senior Engineer's Playbook: Deconstructing the E-commerce System Design Interview

**Introduction: Beyond Just "Getting it to Work"**
*   Why these questions are asked: Testing for long-term vision, not just short-term solutions.
*   The three core principles of the interview: Scalability, Resilience, and Maintainability.

**Part 1: The Foundation - Asking the Right Questions First**
*   **Chapter 1.1: Why Business Questions Dictate Architecture.**
    *   Analyzing Go-to-Market Strategy (Global vs. Local Launch).
    *   Understanding Data Complexity (Product Variants).
    *   Defining the "Critical Path" (Where to focus the budget for "nines" of availability).

**Part 2: The Blueprint - Services, Boundaries, and Data Flow**
*   **Chapter 2.1: Decomposing the Monolith.**
    *   Why a single application fails at this scale.
    *   Introducing Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA).
    *   Defining the core services: `API Gateway`, `Product`, `Search`, `Inventory`, `Cart`, etc.
*   **Chapter 2.2: The Anatomy of a User Request: "Find and Add to Cart".**
    *   Tracing a request from the user's browser to the database.
    *   Understanding synchronous vs. asynchronous communication.
    *   The role of caching for performance.

**Part 3: Deep Dive into Critical Services**
*   **Chapter 3.1: The Search Service - Speed and Eventual Consistency.**
    *   Why a SQL database is the wrong tool for search.
    *   What are Elasticsearch/OpenSearch? (The concept of an inverted index).
    *   **Key Pattern: Change Data Capture (CDC).** A robust way to sync data from your main database (Postgres) to a secondary system (Elasticsearch) without the service knowing.
*   **Chapter 3.2: The Product Catalog - Handling Complexity and Availability.**
    *   Using flexible data models (Postgres with JSONB) for diverse products.
    *   **Key Problem: The Thundering Herd.** How displaying availability can crash your Inventory service.
    *   **Key Pattern: Caching with a Message Bus (Kafka + Redis).** Pushing availability data to a fast cache.
    *   **Key Pattern: The Circuit Breaker.** A safety mechanism to automatically handle a failing dependency and prevent cascading failures.
*   **Chapter 3.3: The Inventory Service - The Fortress of Consistency.**
    *   What "ACID guarantees" really mean and why they're non-negotiable for inventory.
    *   **Key Problem: The Abandoned Cart.** Managing temporary "reservations" on stock.
    *   **Key Pattern: Time-to-Live (TTL) for Reservations.** Using Redis's expiration feature to automate timeouts.
    *   **Key Problem: The "Hot Row" Flash Sale.** What happens when thousands of users try to update the exact same database row at once.
    *   **Advanced Pattern: In-Memory Counters with Asynchronous Write-Back.** A high-performance solution that explicitly trades some durability for massive availability.

**Part 4: The Money Shot - Placing the Order Reliably**
*   **Chapter 4.1: The Distributed Transaction Problem.**
    *   Why you can't have a single database transaction across multiple services (Payment, Inventory, Orders).
*   **Chapter 4.2: Key Pattern: The Saga (Orchestration-based).**
    *   A method for managing a sequence of operations and their "undo" actions (compensating transactions).
    *   Defining the state machine (`PENDING`, `CONFIRMED`, `FAILED`).
*   **Chapter 4.3: Essential Concept: Idempotency.**
    *   What it means ("doing something once, even if you receive the request multiple times").
    *   A standard pattern for preventing double-charges.
*   **Chapter 4.4: Key Refinement: The Asynchronous Saga.**
    *   Why making the user wait is bad for them and for your servers.
    *   Using a message queue (Kafka) to immediately accept the order (`202 Accepted`) and process it in the background.
*   **Chapter 4.5: Designing for Recovery.**
    *   The "Double Refund" race condition and how to prevent it.
    *   The importance of state and interrogating the source of truth (the payment gateway).
    *   Designing "good citizen" background workers (Jitter, Backoff, Bulkheads).

**Part 5: The Long View - Architecting for the Future**
*   **Chapter 5.1: Key Principle: Domain-Driven Design (DDD) & Bounded Contexts.**
    *   Why you should create new services (`Fulfillment`, `Seller`) instead of bloating existing ones.
    *   Keeping services focused on a single business domain.
*   **Chapter 5.2: The Leap to Multi-Tenancy.**
    *   What it means to have third-party sellers on your platform.
    *   Why data must be partitioned at the database level (`PRIMARY KEY (sku_id, seller_id)`).
*   **Chapter 5.3: Evolving Security: From Buyers to Sellers.**
    *   Roles, Permissions, and JWT Claims.
    *   Using the API Gateway as a security enforcement point.

**Conclusion: The Hallmarks of Senior Engineering**
*   Thinking in Trade-offs, Not Absolutes.
*   Designing for Failure, Not Just the Happy Path.
*   Letting the Business Domain Guide the Technical Solution.
