### **Part 3.3: Testing: The Mark of a Professional**

Writing code that works for the happy path is expected of an intern. Writing code that is demonstrably robust against the full spectrum of possible inputs is the baseline for a senior engineer. In a production environment, untested code is considered broken. Your interview is a simulation of a production environment. Failing to rigorously test your own code is not an option; it's a critical failure that signals you are not ready for a role that requires ownership and reliability.

#### **3.3.1 Defining Test Cases Before You Code**

Testing is not something you do at the end. It is an integral part of the problem-solving process that should begin before you write a single line of implementation logic. By defining your test cases upfront, you are creating a concrete specification for your code to pass. This turns a vague problem into a set of measurable success criteria and demonstrates a level of discipline that separates professionals from amateurs.

After clarifying the prompt (3.1.1) and stating your assumptions (3.1.2), your next step should be to say: **"Alright, before I write the code, let's outline the key test cases I'll need to handle to ensure my solution is robust."**

You must be systematic. Generate your test cases by category:

*   **The General / "Happy Path" Case:**
    *   **Purpose:** To verify that your core logic works for a standard, non-trivial input.
    *   **Example:** For "Two Sum" with target 9, a happy path input is `[2, 7, 11, 15]`.

*   **Edge Cases (The Boundaries of the Problem):**
    *   **Purpose:** To probe the limits of your algorithm. This is where naive solutions often break.
    *   **Empty Inputs:** An empty list `[]`, an empty string `""`.
    *   **Null Inputs:** `None` (if your clarifying questions allowed for it).
    *   **Single-Element Inputs:** `[5]`. Can your two-pointer logic handle this?
    *   **Minimum/Maximum Size:** The smallest possible valid input and a hypothetical large input.
    *   **Repetitive Data:** An input where all elements are the same, like `[5, 5, 5, 5]`. How does this affect your duplicate-finding logic?

*   **Corner Cases (The Tricky, Problem-Specific Inputs):**
    *   **Purpose:** To challenge the specific logic you're planning to use. These often reveal hidden flaws in your chosen data structures or algorithms.
    *   **Pre-sorted or Reverse-Sorted Data:** How does `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` affect your Quick Sort pivot choice? How does it affect your Two-Pointers solution?
    *   **Inputs with Duplicates:** For "Two Sum" with target 8, what happens with `[4, 5, 3, 4]`? Does your hash map logic correctly handle overwriting the first index of `4`?
    *   **Negative Numbers, Zeros:** Can your logic handle these if they are within the specified input range? `[-2, 1, 3]`
    *   **Data Causing No Solution:** For "Two Sum" with target 20, the input `[1, 2, 3]` should yield the "failure" result you defined.

*   **Invalid Inputs:**
    *   **Purpose:** To demonstrate that you think about your function as a component in a larger system, which must protect itself from bad data.
    *   **Example:** What should happen if a function expecting a list of integers gets a list of strings? You might not code the handler, but stating, "My implementation will assume the input is valid per our earlier discussion, but a production version would require type checking and throw a `TypeError`," shows maturity.

#### **3.3.2 From Logic to Code: The Dry Run**

Once you have your logic conceptualized and are starting to write code, use one of your pre-defined test cases to perform a **dry run** or **trace**. Do not wait until the very end to test. This is an active debugging technique.

*   **Verbal Walkthrough:** "Let me quickly trace my logic with the duplicate case, `[4, 5, 3, 4]` and target 8.
    1. My `seen_map` is empty.
    2. I'm at index 0, value 4. The complement is 4. Is 4 in `seen_map`? No. I'll add `4: 0` to the map.
    3. I'm at index 1, value 5. The complement is 3. Is 3 in `seen_map`? No. Add `5: 1`.
    4. I'm at index 2, value 3. The complement is 5. Is 5 in `seen_map`? Yes, at index 1. Great, I'll return `[1, 2]`. This path works."

*   **The Power of Finding a Flaw:** A dry run that uncovers a bug before you've fully written the code is a massive success. It demonstrates your ability to self-correct.
    *   **Correct Response:** "Interesting. My trace with the duplicate case `[3, 3]` and target 6 just failed. I see that on the first `3`, I would add `3: 0` to the map. On the second `3`, my code would find the complement `3` in the map and return `[0, 0]`, which is incorrect. I must ensure the index isn't the same. I'll add a check for that. Good thing I tested this case."

#### **3.3.3 The Final Verification: Proving Correctness**

After you've written your code, don't just lean back and say "I'm done." That is incomplete. You must explicitly run through your most critical test cases to formally prove correctness.

*   **Declare Your Intent:** "Okay, the code is written. Now I'm going to validate it against the test cases we discussed earlier."
*   **Write `assert` statements:** Time permitting, writing a few `assert`s is the gold standard. It is clean, formal, and mirrors the practice of unit testing.
    ```python
    print("Running tests...")
    assert my_function([2, 7, 11, 15], 9) == [0, 1]  # Happy path
    assert my_function([5], 10) is None              # Single element
    assert my_function([], 5) is None                # Empty list
    assert my_function([3, 3], 6) == [0, 1]          # Duplicates
    print("All tests passed.")
    ```
*   This act takes 30 seconds but elevates your solution from a mere piece of code to a verified component. It demonstrates an end-to-end professional discipline: you defined the requirements, you wrote the code, and you proved that the code meets the requirements. It is the perfect way to conclude the problem.
