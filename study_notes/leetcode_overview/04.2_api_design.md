### **4.2 API Design: Crafting a Clean Contract**

Every function or class method you write has an Application Programming Interface (API). It is the public face of your code, the set of rules by which other parts of the system will interact with it. In a system design context, we think of REST endpoints or RPC definitions as the API. In a coding interview, your function signature *is* the API. Designing this boundary with precision and foresight is a direct measure of your seniority. A sloppy API creates ambiguity, encourages bugs, and makes code difficult to use and maintain. A clean API is a professional contract.

#### **Principle 1: Names Must Reveal Intent (Command vs. Query)**

The name of a method is the first and most important piece of documentation. It must transparently communicate what the method does and, critically, whether it changes the state of the object. This is the Command-Query Separation (CQS) principle.

*   **Queries:** These methods answer a question about the object's state but do **not** change it. They should be "safe" to call multiple times with no side effects.
    *   **Naming Convention:** Use prefixes like `get_`, `is_`, `has_`, `calculate_`.
    *   **Good:** `get_user_name()`, `is_cache_full()`, `calculate_median()`. The names imply a read-only operation.
    *   **Bad:** `get_and_delete_next_item()`. This name is a lie. It mixes a query with a command, which is an immediate red flag.

*   **Commands:** These methods **do** change the state of the object (they mutate it).
    *   **Naming Convention:** Use strong, active verbs. `set_`, `add_`, `update_`, `register_`, `delete_`.
    *   **Good:** `add_item(item)`, `delete_user(user_id)`, `update_password(new_password)`.
    *   **Bad:** `user_status(is_active)`. What does this do? Does it get the status or set it? The name `set_active_status(is_active)` is unambiguous.

In an interview, articulating this distinction shows design maturity: *"I'm naming this method `get_top_element` because it's a query that only inspects the heap; it doesn't modify it. The method to remove the element will be named `extract_top_element` to signify it is a command that mutates the data structure."*

#### **Principle 2: Designing the Input (Parameters as the Request)**

The parameters of your method are the "request" payload. They must be as specific and clear as possible to prevent misuse.

*   **Avoid Generic Blobs:** A method signature like `process_data(data_dict)` is a weak contract. What keys are required inside `data_dict`? What are their types?
    *   **Better:** Be explicit. `create_user(username: str, email: str, age: int)`. This is self-documenting. The required inputs are clear, and types are annotated.
*   **Handle Configuration Gracefully:** If a class has many configuration options, do not force them all into the `__init__` signature.
    *   **Okay:** `MyComponent(timeout=10, retries=3, cache_size=1024, mode='fast')`
    *   **Often Better:** `MyComponent(config: ConfigObject)`. This groups related configuration into a dedicated object, cleaning up the API and making it easier to manage and extend.
*   **Use Optional Parameters Intelligently:** `None` defaults are powerful for indicating optionality.
    *   **Example:** `get_users(department: str, location: str = None)`. This clearly signals that `location` is an optional filter.

#### **Principle 3: Designing the Output (Return Values as the Response)**

The return value is your API's "response." How your method communicates success, failure, or "not found" is a critical design decision with significant trade-offs. This is a topic I would drill down on in a senior interview.

##### **Scenario: `find_user_by_id(user_id)`**

How do you handle the case where the `user_id` does not exist?

*   **Option A: Return `None`**
    *   **The Signal:** This is a simple, common Pythonic approach. It works well for straightforward "not found" scenarios.
    *   **The Risk:** It forces the caller to be diligent. If the caller forgets to check `if user is not None:`, they will get a `NoneType has no attribute '...'.` error downstream, which can be hard to debug. It creates a potential landmine.

*   **Option B: Raise an Exception (e.g., `UserNotFoundError`)**
    *   **The Signal:** This is a much stronger, more explicit contract. It says, "The absence of this user is an exceptional event that the caller *must* deal with." The program will crash if the caller doesn't handle it with a `try...except` block.
    *   **The Trade-off:** This is "louder" and more heavyweight than returning `None`. It should be reserved for truly exceptional or unexpected situations. Is a user not being found truly an *error*, or is it an expected possibility? The answer depends on the system's context.

*   **Option C: Return an Empty Optional / Collection**
    *   **The Signal:** When returning a list of items, always return an empty list `[]` instead of `None` if nothing is found. This is a massive win for the caller. They can iterate over the result (`for user in find_users_by_department(...)`) without adding a `if result is not None` check. It's a "safer" and more convenient API.

*   **Discussion in an Interview:** You must be able to debate these.
    *   *"For `find_user_by_id`, since a caller is asking for a specific ID, they likely expect it to exist. Therefore, a user not being found is an exceptional event, and I would choose to raise a custom `UserNotFoundError`. This makes the contract explicit and prevents latent `None` reference bugs."*
    *   *"However, for a method like `find_users_by_name(name)`, where multiple or zero users could match, returning an empty list `[]` is the superior design. The caller can safely iterate on the result regardless, which simplifies their code."*

#### **Principle 4: Hide Your Implementation Details**

A clean API only exposes what the caller needs to know and use. Internal helper methods, state variables, and constants should be kept private to give you the flexibility to change the implementation later without breaking your callers.

*   **The Python Convention: Underscore Prefix**
    *   In Python, the convention for internal-use attributes or methods is a leading underscore.
    *   `self.cache_size` (Public API, intended for user configuration)
    *   `self._internal_cache_dict` (Private, an implementation detail. The user of the class should not touch this directly).
    *   **Your monologue should reflect this:** *"I'm going to store the user data in a dictionary named `_user_data`. I'm prefixing it with an underscore to signal that this is an internal implementation detail of the class and not part of the public API. This gives us the freedom to change from a `dict` to a database connection later without breaking any clients."*
