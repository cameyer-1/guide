### 1) Understanding and Visualization

This problem asks for the number of distinct *sequences* that sum to `target`. This means the order of numbers matters. For example, if `nums = [1, 2]` and `target = 3`, `(1, 2)` and `(2, 1)` are counted as two separate combinations.

Let's break down the logic. To find the number of ways to form `target`, we can think about the last number chosen for the sequence. It must be one of the numbers from the `nums` array.

-   If the last number is `nums[0]`, then the preceding numbers in the sequence must sum to `target - nums[0]`.
-   If the last number is `nums[1]`, the preceding numbers must sum to `target - nums[1]`.
-   And so on for every number in `nums`.

This creates a recurrence relation. Let `Ways(t)` be the number of ways to make sum `t`. Then:
`Ways(t) = Ways(t - nums[0]) + Ways(t - nums[1]) + ...`

The base case is `Ways(0) = 1`, as there is one way to make a sum of zero: by choosing no numbers.

Let's illustrate the recursive calls for `nums = [1, 2, 3]` and `target = 4` using a dependency tree. This shows which subproblems are needed to solve a larger problem.

**Dependency Tree for `target = 4`:**

```
To calculate Ways(4), we need:
    -> Ways(3)
    -> Ways(2)
    -> Ways(1)

To calculate Ways(3), we need:
    -> Ways(2)   <-- Overlapping subproblem
    -> Ways(1)   <-- Overlapping subproblem
    -> Ways(0)   <-- Base case

To calculate Ways(2), we need:
    -> Ways(1)   <-- Overlapping subproblem
    -> Ways(0)   <-- Base case

To calculate Ways(1), we need:
    -> Ways(0)   <-- Base case
```
This dependency structure clearly shows that to solve for `Ways(4)`, we will end up needing the result for `Ways(2)` and `Ways(1)` multiple times. A simple recursive approach would re-calculate these values unnecessarily, leading to a major inefficiency. This structure is a classic sign that dynamic programming is a suitable optimization.

### 2) Brute Force Approach

The recurrence relation `Ways(t) = sum(Ways(t - num))` for each `num` in `nums` directly translates to a recursive brute-force solution.

The logic of this function, let's call it `solve(current_target)`, is:
1.  **Base Case 1:** If `current_target == 0`, a valid sequence of choices has been made. Return `1`.
2.  **Base Case 2:** If `current_target < 0`, this path is invalid. Return `0`.
3.  **Recursive Step:**
    *   Initialize a counter `total_ways = 0`.
    *   Iterate through each `num` in the `nums` array.
    *   Add the result of `solve(current_target - num)` to `total_ways`.
    *   Return `total_ways`.

The initial call to find the final answer would be `solve(target)`.

**Why it's inefficient:** As shown in our dependency tree, this approach has overlapping subproblems. `solve(2)` would be called independently by `solve(4)` and `solve(3)`. `solve(1)` would be called by `solve(4)`, `solve(3)`, and `solve(2)`. This repeated computation leads to an exponential time complexity, making it too slow for the problem's constraints.

### 3) Optimization

The inefficiency from re-calculating the same subproblems can be solved with **Dynamic Programming**. We can store the result for each subproblem `Ways(t)` the first time we compute it, and then reuse that stored result for subsequent calls.

We'll use the **Bottom-Up (Tabulation)** approach. This method builds the solution from the smallest subproblem (`target = 0`) up to the final `target`. It is iterative and avoids recursion, often making it slightly more performant.

**Algorithm:**
1.  Create a DP array, `dp`, of size `target + 1`. `dp[i]` will store the number of combinations that sum up to `i`. Initialize it with zeros.
2.  Set the base case: `dp[0] = 1`. There is one way to make a sum of 0 (by choosing no numbers).
3.  Iterate through each sub-target `i` from `1` up to `target`.
4.  For each `i`, iterate through every `num` in the `nums` array.
5.  The core logic is: if we can use `num` to reach the current target `i` (i.e., `i - num >= 0`), then the number of ways to do so is the number of ways we could form the sub-target `i - num`.
6.  Therefore, we add the solutions from the smaller subproblems: `dp[i] += dp[i - num]`.
7.  After the loops finish, `dp[target]` will hold the final answer.

This DP approach reduces the time complexity to `O(target * n)` (where `n = len(nums)`) and the space complexity to `O(target)`.

### 4) Walk-through

Let's trace the bottom-up DP solution with `nums = [1, 2, 3]` and `target = 4`.

1.  **Initialization:**
    *   `dp` array of size `5` initialized to zeros: `dp = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`
    *   Set base case `dp[0] = 1`: `dp = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]`

2.  **Loop for `i = 1`:** (Find `Ways(1)`)
    *   `num = 1`: `1 >= 1` is true. `dp[1] += dp[1-1]` => `dp[1] = 0 + dp[0] = 1`.
    *   `num = 2, 3`: Inapplicable.
    *   Result: `dp = [1, 1, 0, 0, 0]`

3.  **Loop for `i = 2`:** (Find `Ways(2)`)
    *   `num = 1`: `2 >= 1` is true. `dp[2] += dp[2-1]` => `dp[2] = 0 + dp[1] = 1`.
    *   `num = 2`: `2 >= 2` is true. `dp[2] += dp[2-2]` => `dp[2] = 1 + dp[0] = 2`.
    *   `num = 3`: Inapplicable.
    *   Result: `dp = [1, 1, 2, 0, 0]`

4.  **Loop for `i = 3`:** (Find `Ways(3)`)
    *   `num = 1`: `3 >= 1`. `dp[3] += dp[3-1]` => `dp[3] = 0 + dp[2] = 2`.
    *   `num = 2`: `3 >= 2`. `dp[3] += dp[3-2]` => `dp[3] = 2 + dp[1] = 3`.
    *   `num = 3`: `3 >= 3`. `dp[3] += dp[3-3]` => `dp[3] = 3 + dp[0] = 4`.
    *   Result: `dp = [1, 1, 2, 4, 0]`

5.  **Loop for `i = 4`:** (Find `Ways(4)`)
    *   `num = 1`: `4 >= 1`. `dp[4] += dp[4-1]` => `dp[4] = 0 + dp[3] = 4`.
    *   `num = 2`: `4 >= 2`. `dp[4] += dp[4-2]` => `dp[4] = 4 + dp[2] = 6`.
    *   `num = 3`: `4 >= 3`. `dp[4] += dp[4-3]` => `dp[4] = 6 + dp[1] = 7`.
    *   Result: `dp = [1, 1, 2, 4, 7]`

6.  **Final Answer:** The loop is finished. The value at `dp[target]` is `dp[4]`, which is `7`.

### 5) Implementation

Here is the Python implementation of the optimized bottom-up dynamic programming solution.

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def combinationSum4(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        """
        Calculates the number of possible combinations that add up to target
        using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach.
        """
        
        # dp[i] will store the number of combinations that sum up to i.
        # We need target + 1 elements to cover the range [0, target].
        # Python's integers handle arbitrary size, and the problem guarantees
        # the answer fits in a 32-bit integer, so overflow is not an issue.
        dp = [0] * (target + 1)
        
        # Base case: There is one way to make a sum of 0, which is by
        # selecting no numbers. This is the foundation of our DP solution.
        dp[0] = 1
        
        # We iterate from the smallest subproblem (target=1) up to the final target.
        # This is the "bottom-up" approach.
        for i in range(1, target + 1):
            # For each sub-target `i`, we test each number in `nums`.
            for num in nums:
                # A number `num` can contribute to the sum `i` if `i >= num`.
                # If so, we can form combinations for `i` by taking any
                # combination that forms `i - num` and adding `num` to it.
                if i - num >= 0:
                    # The number of ways to form `i` is thus increased by the
                    # number of ways to form the remaining amount, `i - num`.
                    dp[i] += dp[i - num]
                    
        # After the loops, dp[target] contains the total number of combinations
        # that sum up to the target.
        return dp[target]

```

### 6) Follow-ups

**Follow-up Question:** What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array? How does it change the problem? What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?

**Answer:**

Allowing negative numbers fundamentally changes the problem and can lead to an **infinite number of solutions**.

**1. The Problem: Infinite Cycles**

Consider an example: `nums = [1, -1]` and `target = 1`.
Valid combinations include:
*   `(1)`
*   `(1, 1, -1)` (sums to 1)
*   `(1, -1, 1)` (sums to 1)
*   `(1, 1, -1, 1, -1)` (sums to 1)

If there is any subset of `nums` that sums to 0 (like `[1, -1]` here), we can add that subset to any valid combination an infinite number of times, creating an infinite number of new valid combinations. The DP recurrence `dp[i] = dp[i] + dp[i - num]` would also lead to an infinite loop. For example, to calculate `dp[i]`, we might need `dp[i - (-1)]` which is `dp[i+1]`, a state that we haven't computed yet in our bottom-up approach.

**2. Necessary Limitation**

To make the problem solvable, we must add a constraint that prevents these infinite paths. The most common constraint is to **limit the length of the combination sequence**.

For instance, the question could be rephrased as:
"Given `nums`, `target`, and an integer `k`, find the number of possible combinations **of length at most `k`** that add up to `target`."

**How this changes the solution:**

With a length constraint, our DP state must be expanded to track length. We would use a 2D DP array:

`dp[j][i]` = the number of ways to form sum `i` using exactly `j` numbers.

The DP state transition would then be: `dp[j][i] = sum(dp[j-1][i - num])` over all `num` in `nums`.

*   **State:** `dp` table of size `(k+1) x (possible_sum_range)`. The sum `i` can now be negative, so the range needs careful handling.
*   **Base Case:** `dp[0][0] = 1`.
*   **Iteration:** Loop `j` from 1 to `k` (length), then loop `i` over the possible sums, then for each `num` in `nums`.
*   **Final Answer:** Sum `dp[j][target]` for all valid lengths `j <= k`.

This new state definition breaks the infinite cycles because each recursive step consumes one unit of length (`j`), and the total length is bounded by `k`.
