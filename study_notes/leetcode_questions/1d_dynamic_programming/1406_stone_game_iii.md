### 1) Understanding and Visualization

This is a turn-based game where two players, Alice and Bob, make optimal choices. The term "optimal choice" is a strong indicator for algorithms like minimax or dynamic programming. The game is zero-sum in a relative sense: since the total value of all stones is constant, one player maximizing their score directly minimizes the score the other player can get from the remaining stones.

Let's define what a player wants to achieve on their turn. A player's best move is one that maximizes their final score. A more useful way to frame this for a turn-based game is to say a player wants to maximize the *difference* between their score and their opponent's score.

Let's use the example `stoneValue = [1, 2, 3, 7]` to visualize the decision-making process.

Alice starts at index 0. She has three possible moves, and she must evaluate the consequences of each one, assuming Bob will also play optimally.

*   **Alice's Option 1: Take 1 stone.**
    *   She takes the stone with value `1`. Her score increases by 1.
    *   The remaining stones are `[2, 3, 7]`.
    *   It is now Bob's turn. Bob will play optimally on `[2, 3, 7]` to maximize his own score difference from this point forward.

*   **Alice's Option 2: Take 2 stones.**
    *   She takes stones with values `1, 2`. Her score increases by `1 + 2 = 3`.
    *   The remaining stones are `[3, 7]`.
    *   It is now Bob's turn to play optimally on `[3, 7]`.

*   **Alice's Option 3: Take 3 stones.**
    *   She takes stones with values `1, 2, 3`. Her score increases by `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.
    *   The remaining stones are `[7]`.
    *   It is now Bob's turn to play optimally on `[7]`.

Alice must simulate the final outcome for each of these three branches to determine her best move. This creates a chain of dependencies: the optimal move at index `i` depends on the optimal outcomes of the sub-games starting at `i+1`, `i+2`, and `i+3`. This structure is perfectly suited for dynamic programming.

### 2) Brute Force Approach

The most direct way to model this game is with recursion. We can define a function, `solve(i)`, that determines the outcome of the game for the player whose turn it is, starting from the stones at index `i`.

Let's define the return value of `solve(i)` as the **maximum score difference** the current player can achieve over their opponent, given the stones from `stoneValue[i:]`.

*   The current player at index `i` can take `k` stones (where `k` is 1, 2, or 3).
*   If the player takes `k` stones, their score increases by `current_take = sum(stoneValue[i:i+k])`.
*   The game then proceeds to the next player, starting at index `i+k`. According to our function's definition, that player (the opponent) will achieve a maximum score difference of `solve(i+k)` on the remaining stones.
*   Therefore, from the original player's perspective, their score difference for this move is `current_take - solve(i+k)`.
*   The player wants to maximize this difference, so they will choose the `k` that yields the highest value.

The recursive relation would be:
`solve(i) = max( (sum of first 1 stone) - solve(i+1),`
`               (sum of first 2 stones) - solve(i+2),`
`               (sum of first 3 stones) - solve(i+3) )`

**Base Case:** If `i >= len(stoneValue)`, no stones are left, so the score difference is 0.

This approach is correct but inefficient. The function `solve(i)` will be called with the same index `i` many times through different paths in the game tree. This leads to exponential time complexity, roughly O(3^N), which is too slow for the given constraints.

### 3) Optimization

The brute-force solution suffers from re-calculating the same subproblems repeatedly (e.g., `solve(5)` might be needed to find `solve(4)`, `solve(3)`, and `solve(2)`). This is a hallmark of dynamic programming.

We can optimize this using memoization (top-down DP) or by building the solution iteratively (bottom-up DP). The bottom-up approach is often slightly more efficient in Python and avoids recursion depth limits.

**Bottom-Up DP (Tabulation):**

We will create a `dp` array where `dp[i]` stores the result of `solve(i)`â€”the maximum score difference the current player can obtain from the sub-array `stoneValue[i:]`.

To calculate `dp[i]`, we need the results from `dp[i+1]`, `dp[i+2]`, and `dp[i+3]`. This dependency means we must compute the `dp` values from right to left, starting from the end of the array and moving towards the beginning.

**State:** `dp[i]` = Maximum score difference for the player whose turn it is at index `i`.
**Transition:**
For `i` from `n-1` down to `0`:
`dp[i] = max_{k=1,2,3} ( sum(stoneValue[i:i+k]) - dp[i+k] )`

The final answer is determined by `dp[0]`, which represents the score difference Alice can achieve starting from the very beginning.
*   If `dp[0] > 0`, Alice wins.
*   If `dp[0] < 0`, Bob wins.
*   If `dp[0] == 0`, it's a tie.

**Space Optimization:**
Notice that to compute `dp[i]`, we only rely on the next three values: `dp[i+1]`, `dp[i+2]`, and `dp[i+3]`. We don't need the entire history of `dp` values. This allows us to optimize space. Instead of an O(N) array, we only need to store a constant number of results (three, in this case). We can use a small, fixed-size array of size 4 and use modular arithmetic (`i % 4`) to cycle through it, effectively storing only the last three computed DP values.

### 4) Walk-through

Let's trace the space-optimized bottom-up DP with `stoneValue = [1, 2, 3, 7]`.
`n = 4`. We will compute `dp[i]` for `i` from `3` down to `0`. We need `dp` values for indices `i+1, i+2, i+3`. For any `j >= n`, `dp[j]` is conceptually 0 (no stones left).

Let's maintain the required future states explicitly. Let `dp1`, `dp2`, `dp3` be the values for `dp[i+1]`, `dp[i+2]`, and `dp[i+3]`.

*   **Initial state (for `i=3`):** `dp1 = dp[4]=0`, `dp2 = dp[5]=0`, `dp3 = dp[6]=0`.

*   **`i = 3`** (Stones: `[7]`)
    *   Take 1 stone (value 7): diff = `7 - dp[4] = 7 - dp1 = 7 - 0 = 7`.
    *   `dp[3] = 7`.
    *   Update future states for next iteration (`i=2`): `dp3=dp2=0`, `dp2=dp1=0`, `dp1=dp[3]=7`. Now `(dp1, dp2, dp3) = (7, 0, 0)`.

*   **`i = 2`** (Stones: `[3, 7]`)
    *   Take 1 stone (value 3): diff = `3 - dp[3] = 3 - dp1 = 3 - 7 = -4`.
    *   Take 2 stones (value 3+7=10): diff = `10 - dp[4] = 10 - dp2 = 10 - 0 = 10`.
    *   `dp[2] = max(-4, 10) = 10`.
    *   Update future states for next iteration (`i=1`): `dp3=dp2=0`, `dp2=dp1=7`, `dp1=dp[2]=10`. Now `(dp1, dp2, dp3) = (10, 7, 0)`.

*   **`i = 1`** (Stones: `[2, 3, 7]`)
    *   Take 1 (value 2): diff = `2 - dp[2] = 2 - dp1 = 2 - 10 = -8`.
    *   Take 2 (value 2+3=5): diff = `5 - dp[3] = 5 - dp2 = 5 - 7 = -2`.
    *   Take 3 (value 2+3+7=12): diff = `12 - dp[4] = 12 - dp3 = 12 - 0 = 12`.
    *   `dp[1] = max(-8, -2, 12) = 12`.
    *   Update future states for next iteration (`i=0`): `dp3=dp2=7`, `dp2=dp1=10`, `dp1=dp[1]=12`. Now `(dp1, dp2, dp3) = (12, 10, 7)`.

*   **`i = 0`** (Stones: `[1, 2, 3, 7]`)
    *   Take 1 (value 1): diff = `1 - dp[1] = 1 - dp1 = 1 - 12 = -11`.
    *   Take 2 (value 1+2=3): diff = `3 - dp[2] = 3 - dp2 = 3 - 10 = -7`.
    *   Take 3 (value 1+2+3=6): diff = `6 - dp[3] = 6 - dp3 = 6 - 7 = -1`.
    *   `dp[0] = max(-11, -7, -1) = -1`.

The final result is `dp[0] = -1`. Since this represents Alice's score difference, and it's negative, Bob wins.

### 5) Implementation

Here is the Python code for the space-optimized bottom-up DP solution.

        # We use modular arithmetic (i % 4) to cycle through this small array.
        # dp[k] will effectively store the result for an index j where j % 4 == k.
        # It is initialized to 0, which correctly handles the base cases where i >= n.
        dp = [0] * 4

        # Iterate backwards from the end of the stone values.
        # The dp state for index i depends on states for i+1, i+2, and i+3.
        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
            # At the start of each iteration i, we want to calculate dp[i].
            # Initialize it to a very small number to ensure the max operation works correctly.

            for k in range(1, 4):
                # Check if the move is valid (i.e., we don't take stones beyond the end of the array).
                if i + k - 1 < n:
                    # Add the value of the next stone to our running sum for this move.
                    current_sum += stoneValue[i + k - 1]
                    
                    # This is the core DP transition.
                    # The value of this move is (stones I take) - (opponent's max score difference from what's left).
                    # `dp[(i + k) % 4]` holds the pre-computed optimal result for the subproblem starting at i+k.
                    move_value = current_sum - dp[(i + k) % 4]
                    
                    # The current player wants to choose the move that maximizes their score difference.
                    dp[i % 4] = max(dp[i % 4], move_value)

        # After the loop, dp[0] contains the max score difference Alice can achieve from the start.
        score_difference = dp[0]
        
        if score_difference > 0:
            return "Alice"
        elif score_difference < 0:

        else:
            return "Tie"

```

### 6) Follow-ups

An interviewer might ask the following questions to test deeper understanding:

**1. What are the time and space complexities of your solution?**
*   **Time Complexity:** O(N). We iterate through the `stoneValue` array once (from `n-1` down to `0`). Inside this loop, we have another loop that runs a constant number of times (at most 3). Thus, the total time is proportional to N.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). We use a `dp` array of a fixed size (4), which does not depend on the input size N. Therefore, the space is constant.

**2. What if a player could take up to `M` stones instead of 3?**
*   The logic remains identical. The only changes would be:
    *   The inner loop would iterate from `1` to `M` instead of `1` to `3`.
    *   The space optimization would require a `dp` array of size `M+1` to store the necessary future states.
*   The time complexity would become O(N * M) and the space complexity would be O(M).

**3. How would you modify your code to not just return the winner, but also the sequence of moves Alice and Bob would make?**
*   To reconstruct the optimal path, we need to store which move (`k=1, 2, or 3`) led to the maximum value at each step.
*   We could use a second array, say `path[n]`, where `path[i]` stores the optimal number of stones to take at index `i`. This would be populated inside the inner loop whenever we find a new maximum `dp[i % 4]`.
*   After filling the `dp` and `path` tables, we can reconstruct the game. Start at index `i = 0`. Alice takes `path[0]` stones. The new index becomes `i = i + path[0]`. Now it's Bob's turn, and he will take `path[i]` stones, and so on, until all stones are taken.

**4. What if players could take stones from either the beginning or the end of the row?**
*   This fundamentally changes the problem. The state of the game can no longer be described by a single starting index `i`, because the remaining stones may not be a contiguous block from the original array.
*   The state must be defined by a pair of indices `(left, right)`, representing the remaining subarray of stones.
*   The DP state would become `dp[left][right]`, representing the maximum score difference the current player can achieve from the subarray `stoneValue[left:right+1]`.
*   The transition would involve choosing to take stones from `left` or `right` and recursively solving for the smaller subproblem. This is a different, well-known DP problem. The complexity would be O(N^2) for both time and space.
