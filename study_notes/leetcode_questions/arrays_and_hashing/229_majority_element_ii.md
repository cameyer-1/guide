### 1) Understanding and Visualization

First, let's ensure we have a solid grasp of the problem. We are given an array of integers, `nums`, and a target integer, `k`. Our task is to find the total count of **contiguous subarrays** whose elements sum up to `k`.

Let's use a more illustrative example: `nums = [3, 4, 7, 2, -3, 1, 4, 2]` and `k = 7`.

A "subarray" must be a continuous block of elements. For instance, `[4, 7, 2]` is a subarray, but `[4, 2, 1]` is not.

Let's visualize the subarrays that sum to `k=7` in our example:

**Example:** `nums = [3, 4, 7, 2, -3, 1, 4, 2]`, `k = 7`

1.  `[3, 4]`
    *   Indices: 0 to 1
    *   Sum: 3 + 4 = 7

2.  `[7]`
    *   Indices: 2 to 2
    *   Sum: 7 = 7

3.  `[7, 2, -3, 1]`
    *   Indices: 2 to 5
    *   Sum: 7 + 2 + (-3) + 1 = 7

4.  `[1, 4, 2]`
    *   Indices: 5 to 7
    *   Sum: 1 + 4 + 2 = 7

Based on our visualization, the expected output for this example is `4`. The presence of negative numbers is a key detail; it means that adding more elements to a subarray could either increase or decrease its sum.

### 2) Brute Force Approach

The most straightforward way to solve this is to generate every possible contiguous subarray, calculate its sum, and check if that sum equals `k`.

**Algorithm:**
1.  Initialize a counter, `count`, to 0.
2.  Iterate through the array with an outer loop using an index `i` from `0` to `n-1` (where `n` is the length of the array). This index `i` will represent the starting point of our subarray.
3.  Inside the outer loop, start an inner loop with an index `j` from `i` to `n-1`. This index `j` will be the ending point of our subarray.
4.  For each pair of `(i, j)`, calculate the sum of the subarray `nums[i...j]`.
5.  If this sum equals `k`, increment `count`.
6.  After both loops complete, `count` will hold the total number of qualifying subarrays.

**Let's apply this to `nums = [1, 2, 3]`, `k = 3`:**

*   **i = 0:**
    *   **j = 0:** subarray `[1]`, sum = 1.
    *   **j = 1:** subarray `[1, 2]`, sum = 3. `count` becomes 1.
    *   **j = 2:** subarray `[1, 2, 3]`, sum = 6.
*   **i = 1:**
    *   **j = 1:** subarray `[2]`, sum = 2.
    *   **j = 2:** subarray `[2, 3]`, sum = 5.
*   **i = 2:**
    *   **j = 2:** subarray `[3]`, sum = 3. `count` becomes 2.

Final `count` is 2. The method is correct.

**Complexity Analysis:**
*   **Time Complexity:** O(n²). The two nested loops are the dominant factor. (A slightly more naive version might use a third loop to sum, leading to O(n³), but we can optimize that by maintaining a running sum in the inner loop).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). We only use a few variables to store the count and the current sum.

This approach is too slow for the given constraints (`n` up to 2 * 10⁴), as n² would be around 4 * 10⁸ operations, which will time out.

### 3) Optimization

The O(n²) complexity arises from recalculating sums for overlapping subarrays. We need a way to avoid this redundant work. The key insight lies in using **prefix sums**.

A prefix sum `P[i]` is the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i`.
`P[i] = nums[0] + nums[1] + ... + nums[i]`

Now, consider the sum of a subarray from index `j` to `i` (where `j <= i`):
`sum(nums[j...i]) = P[i] - P[j-1]`

We are looking for subarrays where `sum(nums[j...i]) = k`. Substituting our formula:
`P[i] - P[j-1] = k`

If we rearrange this equation, we get a powerful new target:
`P[i] - k = P[j-1]`

This means that as we iterate through the array and calculate the current prefix sum (`P[i]`), we can ask a new question: "How many times have we previously seen a prefix sum equal to `P[i] - k`?" Each time we've seen it marks the start of a new subarray that sums to `k`.

To efficiently look up the count of previous prefix sums, a **hash map (dictionary)** is the perfect data structure. We can store prefix sums as keys and their frequencies (how many times they have occurred) as values.

**Optimized Algorithm:**
1.  Initialize `count = 0` and `current_sum = 0`.
2.  Create a hash map `prefix_sum_freq` to store the frequencies of prefix sums.
3.  Initialize the map with `{0: 1}`. This is a crucial step. It handles cases where a subarray starting from index 0 sums to `k`. In our formula, `P[i] - k = P[j-1]`, if `P[i]` itself is `k`, then we are looking for a `P[j-1]` of `k - k = 0`. The "empty" prefix before the array starts has a sum of 0, so we seed our map with this value.
4.  Iterate through the `nums` array, element by element.
5.  For each element `num`, add it to `current_sum`.
6.  Calculate the `target` prefix sum we need: `target = current_sum - k`.
7.  Check if `target` exists in `prefix_sum_freq`. If it does, it means there are `prefix_sum_freq[target]` subarrays ending at the current position that sum to `k`. Add this frequency to our `count`.
8.  After checking, update the map with the `current_sum`. Increment its frequency by 1.
9.  Return `count`.

### 4) Walk-through

Let's trace the optimized algorithm with our example: `nums = [3, 4, 7, 2, -3, 1, 4, 2]`, `k = 7`.

**Initial State:**
*   `count = 0`
*   `current_sum = 0`
*   `prefix_sum_freq = {0: 1}`

**Iteration 1 (num = 3):**
*   `current_sum` becomes `0 + 3 = 3`.
*   `target = current_sum - k = 3 - 7 = -4`.
*   Is `-4` in `prefix_sum_freq`? No.
*   Update map: `prefix_sum_freq` is now `{0: 1, 3: 1}`.

**Iteration 2 (num = 4):**
*   `current_sum` becomes `3 + 4 = 7`.
*   `target = 7 - 7 = 0`.
*   Is `0` in `prefix_sum_freq`? Yes, its frequency is `1`.
*   `count` becomes `0 + 1 = 1`. (Found subarray `[3, 4]`).
*   Update map: `prefix_sum_freq` is now `{0: 1, 3: 1, 7: 1}`.

**Iteration 3 (num = 7):**
*   `current_sum` becomes `7 + 7 = 14`.
*   `target = 14 - 7 = 7`.
*   Is `7` in `prefix_sum_freq`? Yes, its frequency is `1`.
*   `count` becomes `1 + 1 = 2`. (Found subarray `[7]`. Why? Because `current_sum` up to index 2 is 14, and `prefix_sum_freq` had a 7 for the prefix `[3, 4]`. The difference `14 - 7` is 7, corresponding to the subarray between these two points).
*   Update map: `prefix_sum_freq` is now `{0: 1, 3: 1, 7: 1, 14: 1}`.

**Iteration 4 (num = 2):**
*   `current_sum` becomes `14 + 2 = 16`.
*   `target = 16 - 7 = 9`.
*   Is `9` in `prefix_sum_freq`? No.
*   Update map: `{0: 1, 3: 1, 7: 1, 14: 1, 16: 1}`.

**Iteration 5 (num = -3):**
*   `current_sum` becomes `16 + (-3) = 13`.
*   `target = 13 - 7 = 6`.
*   Is `6` in `prefix_sum_freq`? No.
*   Update map: `{..., 13: 1}`.

**Iteration 6 (num = 1):**
*   `current_sum` becomes `13 + 1 = 14`.
*   `target = 14 - 7 = 7`.
*   Is `7` in `prefix_sum_freq`? Yes, its frequency is `1`.
*   `count` becomes `2 + 1 = 3`. (Found subarray `[7, 2, -3, 1]`).
*   Update map: `prefix_sum_freq[14]` was 1, now becomes 2. The map is now `{0: 1, 3: 1, 7: 1, 14: 2, 16: 1, 13: 1}`.

**Iteration 7 (num = 4):**
*   `current_sum` becomes `14 + 4 = 18`.
*   `target = 18 - 7 = 11`.
*   Is `11` in `prefix_sum_freq`? No.
*   Update map: `{..., 18: 1}`.

**Iteration 8 (num = 2):**
*   `current_sum` becomes `18 + 2 = 20`.
*   `target = 20 - 7 = 13`.
*   Is `13` in `prefix_sum_freq`? Yes, its frequency is `1`.
*   `count` becomes `3 + 1 = 4`. (Found subarray `[1, 4, 2]`).
*   Update map: `{..., 20: 1}`.

End of array. The final `count` is `4`, which matches our manual check.

### 5) Implementation

Here is the Python implementation of the optimized solution.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def subarraySum(nums: list[int], k: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the total number of subarrays whose sum equals k using a hash map and prefix sums.
    """
    
    # Initialize count of subarrays and the current running sum.
    count = 0
    current_sum = 0
    
    # Create a hash map to store the frequency of prefix sums.
    # The key is the prefix sum, and the value is its frequency.
    # We initialize it with {0: 1} to handle cases where a subarray
    # starting from index 0 sums to k.
    prefix_sum_freq = {0: 1}
    
    # Iterate through each number in the input array.
    for num in nums:
        # Update the running sum with the current number.
        current_sum += num
        
        # Calculate the complement we are looking for.
        # If current_sum - k exists as a previous prefix sum,
        # it means the subarray(s) between that point and the current
        # point sum to k.
        # Let's say prefix sum up to index j-1 is P[j-1].
        # And prefix sum up to index i is P[i] (which is current_sum).
        # We need P[i] - P[j-1] = k, which means P[j-1] = P[i] - k.
        diff = current_sum - k
        
        # Check if this complement (diff) exists in our map.
        # The number of times it has occurred is the number of new subarrays
        # we have found ending at the current position.
        # Using .get(key, 0) is safe, as it returns 0 if the key doesn't exist.
        count += prefix_sum_freq.get(diff, 0)
        
        # After checking for the complement, update the map with the current_sum.
        # This records the current prefix sum for future iterations to use.
        prefix_sum_freq[current_sum] = prefix_sum_freq.get(current_sum, 0) + 1
        
    # Return the total count.
    return count

```

**Complexity Analysis of Optimized Solution:**
*   **Time Complexity:** O(n). We iterate through the array once. Hash map operations (insertion and lookup) take O(1) time on average.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(n). In the worst case, every prefix sum is unique, and we would have to store all `n` of them in the hash map.

### 6) Followups

Here are some potential followup questions an interviewer might ask:

**1. What if all the numbers in the array were positive? Could we do better in terms of space?**

*   **Answer:** Yes. If all numbers are positive, we can use a **sliding window** approach, which achieves O(1) space complexity.
*   **Logic:** Maintain a window with a `left` and `right` pointer. Expand the window by moving `right`. If the window's sum exceeds `k`, shrink the window by moving `left` until the sum is less than or equal to `k`. Since all numbers are positive, moving `left` guarantees the sum will decrease. This doesn't work with negative numbers, as shrinking the window might counter-intuitively increase the sum (if a negative number is removed). The sliding window approach would have O(n) time and O(1) space.

**2. What if instead of the count, you need to return one of the actual subarrays? Or all of them?**

*   **Answer:** The core prefix sum logic remains, but we need to modify what the hash map stores.
*   **To return one subarray:** Instead of frequency, the map could store `{prefix_sum: index}`. When you find `target = current_sum - k` in the map at index `i`, you've found a subarray from `map[target] + 1` to `i`. You can return `nums[map[target] + 1 : i + 1]` and stop.
*   **To return all subarrays:** The map would need to store a list of indices for each prefix sum: `{prefix_sum: [index1, index2, ...]}`. When you find `target = current_sum - k`, you would iterate through the list of indices `map[target]`. For each `start_index` in that list, you've found a new subarray `nums[start_index + 1 : i + 1]`. You'd add all these to a result list.

**3. How does your solution handle integer overflow if the sums can get very large?**

*   **Answer:** This depends on the language. In Python, integers have arbitrary precision, so overflow is not an issue. In languages like Java or C++, if the cumulative sum could exceed the capacity of a standard `int` (`2*10^9`), we would need to use a larger data type like `long` (or `long long` in C++) for `current_sum` and the keys of the hash map. The problem constraints (`nums.length <= 2 * 10^4`, `nums[i] <= 1000`) suggest the maximum possible sum is around `2*10^4 * 1000 = 2*10^7`, which fits comfortably within a standard 32-bit signed integer. However, showing awareness of this potential issue is a sign of a thorough engineer.
