### 1. Understanding and Visualization

First, let's ensure we have a solid grasp of the problem. We are given an array of integers, which can be positive, negative, or zero. We need to find the number of *contiguous* subarrays whose elements sum up to a target value `k`.

Let's use a more comprehensive example to visualize this: `nums = [3, 4, 7, 2, -3, 1, 4, 2]` and `k = 7`.

A "subarray" must be a continuous block of elements.

*   `[3, 4]` is a subarray. Its sum is `3 + 4 = 7`. This is one valid subarray.
*   `[7]` is a subarray. Its sum is `7`. This is a second valid subarray.
*   `[3, 7]` is **not** a subarray because it skips the element `4`.

Let's diagram our example and identify all valid subarrays:

```
nums:  [ 3,  4,  7,  2, -3,  1,  4,  2 ]
index:   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
```

Now, let's find the subarrays that sum to `k = 7`:

1.  `nums[0...1]` -> `[3, 4]` -> Sum = 7
2.  `nums[2...2]` -> `[7]` -> Sum = 7
3.  `nums[2...5]` -> `[7, 2, -3, 1]` -> Sum = 7
4.  `nums[5...7]` -> `[1, 4, 2]` -> Sum = 7

In this example, the final output should be **4**. The presence of negative numbers is key; it means that adding more elements to a subarray doesn't guarantee the sum will increase.

### 2. Brute Force Approach

The most straightforward way to solve this is to generate every possible subarray, calculate its sum, and check if that sum equals `k`.

We can define a subarray by its starting and ending points.

**Algorithm:**
1.  Initialize a `count` variable to 0.
2.  Iterate through the array with a pointer `start` from index 0 to `n-1` (where `n` is the length of the array). This `start` pointer will mark the beginning of our subarray.
3.  For each `start` position, iterate with a pointer `end` from `start` to `n-1`. This `end` pointer marks the end of our subarray.
4.  For each subarray defined by `start` and `end`, calculate the sum of its elements.
5.  If the sum equals `k`, increment `count`.
6.  After all loops complete, return `count`.

Let's trace this with a smaller example, `nums = [1, 2, 3]`, `k = 3`.

*   **start = 0**:
    *   **end = 0**: subarray is `[1]`, sum = 1.
    *   **end = 1**: subarray is `[1, 2]`, sum = 3. `sum == k`, so `count` becomes 1.
    *   **end = 2**: subarray is `[1, 2, 3]`, sum = 6.
*   **start = 1**:
    *   **end = 1**: subarray is `[2]`, sum = 2.
    *   **end = 2**: subarray is `[2, 3]`, sum = 5.
*   **start = 2**:
    *   **end = 2**: subarray is `[3]`, sum = 3. `sum == k`, so `count` becomes 2.

The final count is 2.

**Complexity Analysis:**
*   **Time Complexity: O(n^2)**. We have two nested loops to define the subarrays. Inside the inner loop, we can maintain a running sum, which is an O(1) operation. So, the overall complexity is determined by the nested loops.
*   **Space Complexity: O(1)**. We only use a few variables to store the count and the current sum.

For the given constraints (`n <= 2 * 10^4`), an O(n^2) solution would be approximately `(2 * 10^4)^2 = 4 * 10^8` operations, which is too slow and would likely result in a "Time Limit Exceeded" error.

### 3. Optimization

The bottleneck in the brute-force approach is the repeated calculation within the nested loops. We need a more efficient way to find subarray sums. This is a classic use case for the **prefix sum** technique combined with a **hash map**.

**The Core Idea:**
Let `sum(i, j)` be the sum of the subarray `nums[i...j]`.
Let `prefix_sum[i]` be the sum of elements from `nums[0...i]`.

The sum of any subarray `nums[i...j]` can be calculated quickly using prefix sums:
`sum(i, j) = prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i-1]`.

We are looking for subarrays where `sum(i, j) = k`. So, we need to find pairs of indices `i` and `j` such that:
`prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i-1] = k`

Rearranging this equation gives us a powerful insight:
`prefix_sum[i-1] = prefix_sum[j] - k`

This means that as we iterate through the array and calculate the current prefix sum (`prefix_sum[j]`), we can ask: "How many times have we previously seen a prefix sum equal to `prefix_sum[j] - k`?". Each time we have seen it, it marks the beginning of a new subarray that ends at our current position `j` and sums to `k`.

A hash map is the perfect data structure for this task. We can store the prefix sums we've encountered so far and the frequency of each sum.

**Optimized Algorithm:**
1.  Initialize `count = 0`.
2.  Initialize `current_sum = 0`.
3.  Initialize a hash map, `prefix_sum_counts`, to store frequencies of prefix sums. Add an initial entry `{0: 1}`. This is crucial: it handles cases where a subarray starting from index 0 sums to `k`. An empty prefix (before the array starts) has a sum of 0, and it occurs once.
4.  Iterate through each number `num` in the `nums` array:
    a.  Add the number to our running sum: `current_sum += num`.
    b.  Calculate the `complement` we are looking for: `complement = current_sum - k`.
    c.  Check if this `complement` exists as a key in our `prefix_sum_counts` map. If it does, it means there are `prefix_sum_counts[complement]` subarrays that end just before the current element, which we can use to form a valid subarray. Add this frequency to our `count`.
    d.  Update the map with the `current_sum`: increment the count for `current_sum` in the `prefix_sum_counts` map.

**Complexity Analysis:**
*   **Time Complexity: O(n)**. We iterate through the array only once. The hash map operations (insertion and lookup) take O(1) time on average.
*   **Space Complexity: O(n)**. In the worst-case scenario, all prefix sums are unique, and we would store `n` entries in our hash map.

### 4. Walk-through

Let's walk through our original example, `nums = [3, 4, 7, 2, -3, 1, 4, 2]` and `k = 7`, using the optimized approach.

**Initial State:**
*   `count = 0`
*   `current_sum = 0`
*   `prefix_sum_counts = {0: 1}`

**Iteration Loop:**

| `num` | `current_sum` | `complement (sum-k)` | `map[complement]?` | `count` | `prefix_sum_counts`         |
|:------|:--------------|:---------------------|:---------------------|:--------|:----------------------------|
| (start) | 0             | -                    | -                    | 0       | `{0: 1}`                    |
| **3** | 3             | 3 - 7 = -4           | No                   | 0       | `{0: 1, 3: 1}`              |
| **4** | 7             | 7 - 7 = 0            | Yes, `map[0]` is 1   | 0 + 1 = **1** | `{0: 1, 3: 1, 7: 1}`        |
| **7** | 14            | 14 - 7 = 7           | Yes, `map[7]` is 1   | 1 + 1 = **2** | `{0: 1, 3: 1, 7: 2}`        |
| **2** | 16            | 16 - 7 = 9           | No                   | 2       | `{0:1, 3:1, 7:2, 16:1}`     |
| **-3**| 13            | 13 - 7 = 6           | No                   | 2       | `{..., 13:1, 16:1}`         |
| **1** | 14            | 14 - 7 = 7           | Yes, `map[7]` is 2   | 2 + 2 = **4** | `{..., 7:3, 13:1, 14:1, ...}`|
| **4** | 18            | 18 - 7 = 11          | No                   | 4       | `{..., 14:1, 18:1, ...}`    |
| **2** | 20            | 20 - 7 = 13          | Yes, `map[13]` is 1  | 4 + 1 = **5** | `{..., 13:2, 18:1, 20:1}`   |

Whoops, I made a mistake in my manual walkthrough. Let's re-verify the subarrays.

1.  `[3, 4]` (sum=7) -> found when `current_sum=7`, `complement=0`. `map[0]` was 1. Correct. `count=1`.
2.  `[7]` (sum=7) -> found when `current_sum=14`, `complement=7`. `map[7]` was 1 (from the previous step). The prefix sum up to index 1 was 7. The current prefix sum at index 2 is 14. `14 - 7 = 7`. This identifies the subarray between these two points: `nums[2...2]`. Correct. `count=2`.
3.  `[7, 2, -3, 1]` (sum=7) -> `current_sum` up to index 1 is 7. `current_sum` up to index 5 is `14`. The difference `14 - 7 = 7`. This is the subarray `nums[2...5]`. It gets found at index 5.
    Let's retrace the table at `num = 1`: `current_sum` becomes 14. `complement = 7`. The map contains `{0: 1, 3: 1, 7: 2, 16: 1, 13: 1}`. The value for key 7 is 2. We add 2 to count. Why 2?
    *   One corresponds to the prefix sum of 7 we saw at index 1 (`nums[0...1]`). The subarray is `nums[2...5]`.
    *   The other corresponds to the prefix sum of 7 that resulted from the subarray `[7]`. Ah, no, `prefix_sum[2]` is 14. Let's be more careful.
        *   Prefix sum at index 1 (`[3, 4]`) is 7.
        *   Prefix sum at index 5 (`[3, 4, 7, 2, -3, 1]`) is 14. `14 - 7 = 7`. `complement` is 7. We check map for key 7. The frequency of prefix sum 7 is indeed 1. My table was slightly wrong.

Let's do a more precise walk-through.

**State:** `count=0`, `current_sum=0`, `prefix_sum_counts={0: 1}`

1.  `num=3`: `current_sum=3`. `complement=-4`. `map[-4]` DNE. `map` becomes `{0:1, 3:1}`. `count=0`.
2.  `num=4`: `current_sum=7`. `complement=0`. `map[0]` is 1. `count = 0+1=1`. `map` becomes `{0:1, 3:1, 7:1}`.
3.  `num=7`: `current_sum=14`. `complement=7`. `map[7]` is 1. `count = 1+1=2`. `map` becomes `{0:1, 3:1, 7:1, 14:1}`. Oh, the count for key `7` is not updated yet. Update map: `map` now becomes `{0:1, 3:1, 7:1}` and then after this step, it is `{0:1, 3:1, 7:1, 14:1}`. The frequency of key `7` is still 1. Let's re-update the map for key `14`: `{0:1, 3:1, 7:1, 14:1}`. This is getting confusing.

The order matters: check for complement first, then update map with the *new* `current_sum`.

**Revised Walkthrough Table**

| `num` | `current_sum` | `complement (sum-k)` | `map_check(map[comp])` | `count` | Update `map[current_sum]`   | `prefix_sum_counts`             |
|:------|:--------------|:---------------------|:-----------------------|:--------|:------------------------------|:--------------------------------|
|       | 0             |                      |                        | 0       | map[0]++ (init)               | `{0: 1}`                        |
| **3** | 3             | -4                   | `map.get(-4,0)` -> 0   | 0       | `map[3]`++                    | `{0: 1, 3: 1}`                  |
| **4** | 7             | 0                    | `map.get(0,0)` -> 1    | 1       | `map[7]`++                    | `{0: 1, 3: 1, 7: 1}`            |
| **7** | 14            | 7                    | `map.get(7,0)` -> 1    | 2       | `map[14]`++                   | `{0:1, 3:1, 7:1, 14:1}`         |
| **2** | 16            | 9                    | `map.get(9,0)` -> 0    | 2       | `map[16]`++                   | `{..., 14:1, 16:1}`             |
| **-3**| 13            | 6                    | `map.get(6,0)` -> 0    | 2       | `map[13]`++                   | `{..., 13:1, 16:1}`             |
| **1** | 14            | 7                    | `map.get(7,0)` -> 1    | 3       | `map[14]`++ (now is 2)       | `{..., 7:1, 13:1, 14:2, 16:1}`  |
| **4** | 18            | 11                   | `map.get(11,0)` -> 0   | 3       | `map[18]`++                   | `{..., 14:2, 18:1}`             |
| **2** | 20            | 13                   | `map.get(13,0)` -> 1   | 4       | `map[20]`++                   | `{..., 13:2, 18:1, 20:1}`       |

The final count is 4. This matches our initial manual check. The logic holds.

### 5. Implementation

Here is the Python implementation of the optimized solution.

```python
from typing import List

def subarraySum(nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the total number of subarrays whose sum equals k.

    This function uses a hash map to store prefix sums and their frequencies,
    achieving an O(n) time complexity.
    """
    
    # count will store the final result.
    count = 0
    
    # current_sum will keep track of the running prefix sum.
    current_sum = 0
    
    # prefix_sum_counts is a hash map to store the frequency of each prefix sum.
    # The key is the prefix sum, and the value is its frequency.
    # We initialize it with {0: 1} to handle subarrays that start from index 0.
    # For a subarray starting at index 0 that sums to k, its prefix sum is k.
    # The required complement would be k - k = 0.
    prefix_sum_counts = {0: 1}
    
    # Iterate through each number in the input array.
    for num in nums:
        # Update the running sum with the current number.
        current_sum += num
        
        # Calculate the complement we are looking for.
        # If a previous prefix sum equals `current_sum - k`, then the subarray
        # between that point and the current point has a sum of k.
        complement = current_sum - k
        
        # Check if the complement exists in our map.
        # If it does, it means we have found one or more subarrays summing to k.
        # The number of such subarrays is the frequency of that complement.
        # We use .get(key, 0) to safely access the map, returning 0 if the key doesn't exist.
        if complement in prefix_sum_counts:
            count += prefix_sum_counts[complement]
            
        # Update the map with the current prefix sum.
        # If `current_sum` is already a key, increment its value.
        # Otherwise, add it to the map with a value of 1.
        prefix_sum_counts[current_sum] = prefix_sum_counts.get(current_sum, 0) + 1
        
    # Return the total count found.
    return count

```

### 6. Follow-ups

Here are some potential follow-up questions an interviewer might ask.

**1. What if all the numbers in the array were positive? Could you optimize the space complexity?**

*   **Answer:** Yes. If all numbers are guaranteed to be positive, the `current_sum` will be strictly monotonically increasing. This allows us to use the **Sliding Window** technique.
*   **Algorithm:** We would maintain two pointers, `left` and `right`, defining the current window.
    1.  Expand the window by moving `right` and adding `nums[right]` to a `window_sum`.
    2.  While `window_sum > k`, shrink the window by moving `left` and subtracting `nums[left]` from `window_sum`.
    3.  If `window_sum == k`, we've found a valid subarray. We increment our count. Then, we must shrink the window from the `left` to continue searching for other subarrays, as expanding it would definitely make the sum greater than `k`.
*   **Complexity:** This approach has a time complexity of O(n) because each pointer (`left` and `right`) traverses the array at most once. Crucially, its space complexity is O(1), which is an improvement over the O(n) space of the hash map approach.

**2. What if you need to return the actual subarrays, not just the count?**

*   **Answer:** We would need to modify the hash map to store more information. Instead of storing `prefix_sum -> count`, we would store `prefix_sum -> list_of_end_indices`.
*   **Modified Algorithm:**
    1.  The map `prefix_sum_indices` would store `{sum_val: [index1, index2, ...]}` where `index1`, `index2` are the indices where that prefix sum occurred.
    2.  When we are at `current_index` with `current_sum`, we would look for `complement = current_sum - k`.
    3.  If we find it in the map, we would iterate through all `start_indices` in `prefix_sum_indices[complement]`. For each `start_index`, a valid subarray exists from `nums[start_index + 1 ... current_index]`. We would add this subarray to our result list.
    4.  This would increase the space complexity significantly, as we now store lists of indices and the final list of subarrays.

**3. How would you handle potential integer overflow if the sums could exceed the standard integer limits of the language?**

*   **Answer:** This demonstrates an awareness of system limitations. In a language like Java or C++, if `nums` were long and contained large numbers, the `current_sum` could exceed the capacity of a 32-bit `int`. The solution would be to use a 64-bit integer type (`long` in Java, `long long` in C++). In Python, integers have arbitrary precision, so overflow is not an issue, but it is still important to acknowledge the concept. Based on the problem's constraints (`length <= 2*10^4`, `values <= 1000`), the maximum possible sum is around `2*10^7`, which fits within a standard 32-bit signed integer (max value ~`2*10^9`). However, acknowledging this possibility is a sign of a thorough engineer.
