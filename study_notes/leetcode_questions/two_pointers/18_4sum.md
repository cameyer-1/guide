### 1) Understanding and Visualization

The problem asks us to find all unique sets of four numbers in a given array `nums` that add up to a specific `target` value. The indices of these four numbers must be distinct.

Let's use the example `nums = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2]` and `target = 0`.

First, a crucial step in many array problems involving sums and duplicates is to sort the array. This helps in two ways: it makes it easier to find numbers in a structured way (e.g., using two pointers) and simplifies the process of skipping duplicate results.

The sorted version of our `nums` array is: `[-2, -1, 0, 0, 1, 2]`.

Our goal is to find four distinct elements from this sorted array that sum to `0`.

**Visualization:**

Let's represent the sorted array:

```
Index:   0    1    2    3    4    5
Array: [-2,  -1,   0,   0,   1,   2]
Target = 0
```

We need to select four numbers. For instance:

*   **Combination 1:** If we pick `-2`, `-1`, `1`, and `2`.
    *   Sum: `(-2) + (-1) + 1 + 2 = 0`. This is a valid quadruplet.
    *   Result: `[-2, -1, 1, 2]`

*   **Combination 2:** If we pick `-2`, `0`, `0`, and `2`.
    *   Notice there are two `0`s at indices 2 and 3. We can use both.
    *   Sum: `(-2) + 0 + 0 + 2 = 0`. This is also a valid quadruplet.
    *   Result: `[-2, 0, 0, 2]`

*   **Combination 3:** If we pick `-1`, `0`, `0`, and `1`.
    *   Sum: `(-1) + 0 + 0 + 1 = 0`. This is a valid quadruplet.
    *   Result: `[-1, 0, 0, 1]`

The "uniqueness" constraint means that if we found `[-1, 0, 0, 1]`, we should not also include `[0, -1, 1, 0]` in our result, as they contain the same numbers. Sorting the array and then the found quadruplets before adding them to a result set is a common way to handle this. Our optimized approach will handle this more elegantly.

### 2) Brute Force Approach

The most straightforward way to solve this is to check every possible combination of four distinct elements in the array. We can achieve this using four nested loops.

1.  The first loop iterates with index `a` from the beginning to the end of the array.
2.  The second loop iterates with index `b` from `a + 1` to the end.
3.  The third loop iterates with index `c` from `b + 1` to the end.
4.  The fourth loop iterates with index `d` from `c + 1` to the end.

The `+1` in the starting range of each subsequent loop ensures that we are always picking four distinct indices (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`).

Inside the innermost loop, we check if `nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] + nums[d] == target`.

If the sum matches the target, we have a potential quadruplet. To handle the uniqueness of the quadruplets themselves (e.g., `[-1, 0, 0, 1]` is the same as `[0, 1, -1, 0]`), we would sort the four numbers and add them as a tuple to a set. The set data structure automatically handles duplicates.

**Pseudocode:**

```python
result_set = set()
n = len(nums)
for a in range(n):
    for b in range(a + 1, n):
        for c in range(b + 1, n):
            for d in range(c + 1, n):
                if nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] + nums[d] == target:
                    quadruplet = tuple(sorted([nums[a], nums[b], nums[c], nums[d]]))
                    result_set.add(quadruplet)
return [list(q) for q in result_set]
```

**Complexity Analysis:**
*   **Time Complexity: O(n^4)**. Four nested loops give a quartic time complexity, which is too slow for `n=200` (200^4 is 1.6 billion operations).
*   **Space Complexity: O(k)** where `k` is the number of unique quadruplets found. This space is used to store the results.

### 3) Optimization

The O(n^4) complexity is prohibitive. We can improve this by reducing the problem. The core idea is to fix some numbers and then solve a smaller subproblem. This is a common pattern for "k-Sum" style problems.

We can reduce 4Sum to 3Sum, which can in turn be reduced to 2Sum. The 2Sum problem can be solved efficiently on a sorted array using the **Two-Pointer Technique**.

**The Optimized Algorithm:**

1.  **Sort the array `nums`**. This is a O(n log n) operation but is crucial for the subsequent steps.

2.  Iterate through the array with a first pointer `i`. This `i` will pick the first number of our potential quadruplet, `nums[i]`.

3.  Inside this loop, iterate with a second pointer `j` starting from `i + 1`. This will pick the second number, `nums[j]`.

4.  Now the problem is reduced to finding two numbers in the rest of the array (from index `j + 1` to `n - 1`) that sum up to a new target: `new_target = target - nums[i] - nums[j]`. This is a classic 2Sum problem.

5.  We solve this 2Sum problem using two pointers, `left` and `right`.
    *   Initialize `left = j + 1` and `right = n - 1`.
    *   While `left < right`:
        *   Calculate the `current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]`.
        *   If `current_sum < new_target`, we need a larger sum, so we move the left pointer to the right: `left += 1`.
        *   If `current_sum > new_target`, we need a smaller sum, so we move the right pointer to the left: `right -= 1`.
        *   If `current_sum == new_target`, we've found a valid quadruplet: `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[left], nums[right]]`. We add it to our results.

**Handling Duplicates:**
Sorting makes it easy to skip duplicate values to avoid redundant computations and duplicate results.

*   **For the `i` loop:** If we are at `nums[i]` and it's the same as `nums[i-1]`, we have already considered all quadruplets starting with this value. So, we can skip the current `i`. (`if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]: continue`).
*   **For the `j` loop:** Similarly, if `nums[j]` is the same as `nums[j-1]`, we skip it. (`if j > i + 1 and nums[j] == nums[j-1]: continue`).
*   **Inside the 2Sum (left/right pointers):** When we find a valid pair, it's possible the next elements are duplicates (e.g., `[..., 5, 5, 5, ...]`). After adding a result, we must advance the `left` and `right` pointers past all duplicates of their current values to ensure the next pair we find is unique.

**Complexity Analysis:**
*   **Time Complexity: O(n^3)**. Sorting takes O(n log n). Then we have two nested loops (for `i` and `j`), which is O(n^2). The two-pointer scan inside takes O(n) time. This results in O(n^2 * n) = O(n^3). Since O(n^3) dominates O(n log n), the total complexity is O(n^3). This is feasible for `n=200` (8 million operations).
*   **Space Complexity: O(1)** or O(n) depending on the sorting implementation. We don't count the space for the output list itself.

### 4) Walk-through

Let's walk through the optimized solution with our example: `nums = [-2, -1, 0, 0, 1, 2]` and `target = 0`.

**Sorted `nums`:** `[-2, -1, 0, 0, 1, 2]`
**`results` list:** `[]`

1.  **Outer loop `i = 0` (`nums[i] = -2`)**
    *   **Inner loop `j = 1` (`nums[j] = -1`)**
        *   `new_target = 0 - (-2) - (-1) = 3`.
        *   `left = 2`, `right = 5`. `nums[left] = 0`, `nums[right] = 2`.
        *   `sum = 0 + 2 = 2`. `sum < new_target`, so `left++`. (`left` is now 3).
        *   `left = 3`, `right = 5`. `nums[left] = 0`, `nums[right] = 2`.
        *   `sum = 0 + 2 = 2`. `sum < new_target`, so `left++`. (`left` is now 4).
        *   `left = 4`, `right = 5`. `nums[left] = 1`, `nums[right] = 2`.
        *   `sum = 1 + 2 = 3`. `sum == new_target`. **Found a quadruplet!**
        *   Add `[-2, -1, 1, 2]` to `results`. `results` is now `[[-2, -1, 1, 2]]`.
        *   Skip duplicates for `left` and `right`. `nums[4]` is not same as `nums[5]`. `nums[5]` is not same as `nums[4]`.
        *   Increment `left`, decrement `right`. Now `left=5`, `right=4`. The `left < right` condition is false, so this inner while-loop ends.
    *   **Inner loop `j = 2` (`nums[j] = 0`)**
        *   `new_target = 0 - (-2) - 0 = 2`.
        *   `left = 3`, `right = 5`. `nums[left] = 0`, `nums[right] = 2`.
        *   `sum = 0 + 2 = 2`. `sum == new_target`. **Found a quadruplet!**
        *   Add `[-2, 0, 0, 2]` to `results`. `results` is now `[[-2, -1, 1, 2], [-2, 0, 0, 2]]`.
        *   Skip duplicates: `left` becomes 4 as `nums[3]` is a duplicate. Now `left = 4`, `right = 5`.
        *   The condition `left < right` is still true.
        *   `sum = nums[4] + nums[5] = 1 + 2 = 3`. `sum > new_target`. `right--`. (`right` is now 4).
        *   Now `left = 4`, `right = 4`. Loop ends.
    *   The `j` loop continues... until it finishes.

2.  **Outer loop `i = 1` (`nums[i] = -1`)**
    *   (Duplicate check: `nums[1]` is not same as `nums[0]`. Continue.)
    *   **Inner loop `j = 2` (`nums[j] = 0`)**
        *   `new_target = 0 - (-1) - 0 = 1`.
        *   `left = 3`, `right = 5`. `nums[left] = 0`, `nums[right] = 2`.
        *   `sum = 0 + 2 = 2`. `sum > new_target`, so `right--`. (`right` is now 4).
        *   `left = 3`, `right = 4`. `nums[left] = 0`, `nums[right] = 1`.
        *   `sum = 0 + 1 = 1`. `sum == new_target`. **Found a quadruplet!**
        *   Add `[-1, 0, 0, 1]` to `results`. `results` is now `[[-2, -1, 1, 2], [-2, 0, 0, 2], [-1, 0, 0, 1]]`.
        *   ...and so on.

3.  **Outer loop `i = 2` (`nums[i] = 0`)**
    *   (Duplicate check: `nums[2]` is not same as `nums[1]`. Continue.)
    *   **Inner loop `j = 3` (`nums[j] = 0`)**
        *   (Duplicate check for `j`: `j > i+1` is `3 > 2+1` which is false. So we don't skip.)
        *   But `nums[j]` is a duplicate of `nums[j-1]` which is `nums[2]`. `if j > i + 1 and nums[j] == nums[j-1]: continue`. This check (`3 > 3`) is false. My manual trace was slightly off. The code needs the check at the start of the `j` loop `if j > i + 1 and nums[j] == nums[j-1]: continue` to prevent re-processing. The first `j` for `i=1` was `j=2`, giving `[-1, 0, ...]`. The first `j` for `i=2` would also use `0`, leading to the same subproblem. Ah, the check `if i > 0 and nums[i] == nums[i-1]: continue` for the outer loop already prevents this! Let's re-verify. `i=2, nums[2]=0`. `i=1, nums[1]=-1`. `nums[2]!=nums[1]`, so we proceed. Let's see the inner loop `j`. `j=3, nums[3]=0`. Is `nums[3]==nums[2]`? Yes. So this `j` would be skipped by the `if j > i+1 ...` check. This logic is correct and essential.

The process continues until `i` reaches `n-3`, having found all unique quadruplets.

### 5) Implementation

### 6) Follow-ups

An interviewer might ask the following questions to test your depth of understanding.

**1. "This pattern seems general. How would you solve the k-Sum problem?"**

The approach can be generalized to a `k-Sum` problem using recursion.

*   **Function Signature:** `kSum(nums, target, k)`
*   **Base Case:** If `k == 2`, solve it using the two-pointer `2Sum` approach on a sorted array, which we did inside the loops above.
*   **Recursive Step:** For `k > 2`, iterate through the `nums` array with an index `i`. For each `nums[i]`, recursively call `kSum` on the rest of the array (`nums[i+1:]`) to find `k-1` elements that sum to `target - nums[i]`.
*   **Duplicate Handling:** The same logic for skipping duplicates must be applied at each level of the recursion to ensure the final result set is unique.
*   **Complexity:** A k-Sum solution using this recursive method would have a time complexity of O(n^(k-1)).

**2. "Can you solve this with a better time complexity, perhaps O(n^2)?"**

Yes, an O(n^2) time complexity solution exists, but it comes at the cost of O(n^2) space complexity.

*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Create a hash map (dictionary in Python).
    2.  Iterate through all possible pairs of indices `(c, d)` in the array.
    3.  Calculate their sum `s = nums[c] + nums[d]`.
    4.  Store this sum `s` as a key in the hash map. The value would be a list of the pairs of indices `(c, d)` that produce this sum.
    5.  After populating the map, iterate through all different pairs of indices `(a, b)`.
    6.  Calculate their sum `current_sum = nums[a] + nums[b]`.
    7.  Look for `remainder = target - current_sum` in the hash map.
    8.  If the `remainder` exists in the map, we have found potential quadruplets. We would then retrieve the list of pairs `(c, d)` for that remainder and combine them with `(a, b)`, ensuring all four indices `a, b, c, d` are distinct.

*   **Complexity:**
    *   **Time:** O(n^2) to build the map of pair sums, and another O(n^2) to iterate through the other pairs. Total time is O(n^2).
    *   **Space:** O(n^2) because in the worst case, every pair of elements could have a unique sum, leading to a hash map with O(n^2) entries.

This trade-off might be acceptable depending on the memory constraints of the problem. For `n=200`, O(n^2) space is `40,000` which is quite manageable.

**3. "In your code, you added checks to skip duplicate elements. Can you explain the importance of `j > i + 1` in the check for the second element?"**

The check `if j > i + 1 and nums[j] == nums[j-1]: continue` is subtle but important.

Let's break it down:
*   `nums[j] == nums[j-1]` checks if the current element is a duplicate of the one just before it.
*   The `j > i + 1` condition is key. The `j` loop starts at `i + 1`. When `j` is exactly `i + 1`, it's the *first* iteration of the inner `j` loop for a given `i`. At this point, we should *never* skip, because we haven't processed this `nums[j]` value yet in the context of the current `nums[i]`. If we just used `j > 0` or a similar check, we might incorrectly skip the first valid `j` if `nums[i+1]` happens to equal `nums[i]`. The `j > i + 1` condition ensures we only start considering skipping duplicates from the *second* iteration of the inner `j` loop onwards. This correctly avoids redundant computations while ensuring every unique `(i, j)` pair is considered once.
