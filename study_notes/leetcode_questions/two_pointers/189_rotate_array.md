### 1) Understanding and Visualization

The problem asks us to rotate an array `nums` to the right by `k` steps. This means the last `k` elements of the array will become the first `k` elements, and the initial `n-k` elements will be shifted to the right.

Let's use the first example: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` and `k = 3`. The length of the array, `n`, is 7.

We need to move the last `k=3` elements, which are `[5, 6, 7]`, to the front. The first `n-k=4` elements, `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, should follow them.

**Initial State:**
The array can be visualized as two conceptual blocks. The first block contains the `n-k` elements that will be shifted, and the second block contains the `k` elements that will move to the front.

```
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, | 5, 6, 7]
        <-- n-k=4 --> <-- k=3 -->
```

**Rotation Steps (Conceptual):**

1.  **Step 1:** `[7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` (The last element `7` moves to the front).
2.  **Step 2:** `[6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` (The new last element `6` moves to the front).
3.  **Step 3:** `[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]` (The new last element `5` moves to the front).

**Final State:**
The original two blocks have swapped their positions, with the second block now at the beginning.

```
result = [5, 6, 7, | 1, 2, 3, 4]
          <-- k=3 --> <-- n-k=4 -->
```

An important edge case is when `k` is larger than the array's length `n`. Rotating an `n`-element array by `n` steps results in the original array. Therefore, a rotation of `k` steps is equivalent to a rotation of `k % n` steps. This is a crucial optimization to handle large `k` values.

### 2) Brute Force Approach

The most intuitive approach is to simulate the rotation process exactly as described. We can perform a rotation by 1 step, and repeat this action `k` times.

To rotate the array by one step to the right:

1.  Store the last element in a temporary variable.
2.  Shift every element from index `0` to `n-2` one position to the right. That is, `nums[i+1] = nums[i]`. This must be done from right to left to avoid overwriting elements before they are moved.
3.  Place the stored last element at the beginning of the array (`nums[0]`).

We would put this logic inside a loop that runs `k` times.

**Complexity Analysis:**
*   **Time Complexity:** O(N * k). Each of the `k` rotations requires shifting `N` elements, leading to a linear scan of the array. If both `N` and `k` are large (e.g., 10^5), this solution will be too slow and likely result in a "Time Limit Exceeded" error.
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). We only use a single temporary variable to store the element being moved, so the space is constant.

### 3) Optimization

The brute-force approach is inefficient because it repeatedly processes the same elements. We need a way to move elements to their final destination in a single pass.

The follow-up question hints at an in-place solution with O(1) extra space. The most elegant and common way to achieve this is the **Reversal Algorithm**.

The insight is as follows: When we rotate the array `nums` by `k` steps, the last `k` elements move to the front, and the first `n-k` elements move to the back.
Let's represent the array as a concatenation of two parts: `A` (the first `n-k` elements) and `B` (the last `k` elements).
So, `nums = A B`. The desired output is `B A`.

The reversal algorithm achieves this transformation in three steps:

1.  **Reverse the entire array.** This changes `A B` to `B_rev A_rev` (where `_rev` means reversed).
2.  **Reverse the first `k` elements.** This part corresponds to `B_rev`. Reversing it gives us `B`. The array is now `B A_rev`.
3.  **Reverse the remaining `n-k` elements.** This part corresponds to `A_rev`. Reversing it gives us `A`. The array is now `B A`, which is our desired result.

**Complexity Analysis:**
*   **Time Complexity:** O(N). We traverse the array a constant number of times (three sub-array reversals amount to visiting each element twice in total). The first reversal takes O(N) time, the second takes O(k), and the third takes O(n-k). The total time is O(N + k + n-k) = O(2N) = O(N).
*   **Space Complexity:** O(1). The reversals are done in-place, modifying the array directly without allocating any extra data structures proportional to the input size.

### 4) Walk-through

Let's walk through the reversal algorithm with our example: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, `k = 3`.

**Initial State:** `n = 7`.
`nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`

**Pre-computation:**
First, we handle large `k` values.
`k = k % n = 3 % 7 = 3`.
The effective number of rotations is 3.

**Step 1: Reverse the entire array (indices 0 to 6).**
`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` -> `[7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
Current `nums`: `[7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`

**Step 2: Reverse the first `k` elements (indices 0 to k-1 = 2).**
We reverse the sub-array `[7, 6, 5]`.
`[7, 6, 5]` -> `[5, 6, 7]`
Current `nums`: `[5, 6, 7, 4, 3, 2, 1]`

**Step 3: Reverse the remaining `n-k` elements (indices k=3 to n-1=6).**
We reverse the sub-array `[4, 3, 2, 1]`.
`[4, 3, 2, 1]` -> `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
Current `nums`: `[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

**Final State:**
The array is `[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]`, which is the correct rotated array.

### 5) Implementation

For a clean implementation, we can create a helper function that reverses a portion of the array in-place. The main function will then call this helper three times.

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def rotate(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
        """
        Rotates the array nums in-place to the right by k steps.
        This function does not return anything, it modifies nums in-place.
        """
        n = len(nums)
        
        # If the array is empty or has one element, no rotation is needed.
        if n == 0:
            return
            
        # To handle cases where k > n, we take the modulo.
        # Rotating by n is the same as not rotating at all.
        # So, we only need to care about the remainder.
        k = k % n
        
        # If k is 0 after the modulo, no rotation is needed.
        if k == 0:
            return

        # Step 1: Reverse the entire array.
        # From [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] to [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        self._reverse(nums, 0, n - 1)
        
        # Step 2: Reverse the first k elements.
        # k = 3, so we reverse the sub-array from index 0 to 2.
        # From [7, 6, 5] to [5, 6, 7].
        # The array becomes [5, 6, 7, 4, 3, 2, 1]
        self._reverse(nums, 0, k - 1)
        
        # Step 3: Reverse the remaining n-k elements.
        # We reverse the sub-array from index k to n-1.
        # From [4, 3, 2, 1] to [1, 2, 3, 4].
        # The array becomes [5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        self._reverse(nums, k, n - 1)

    def _reverse(self, arr: List[int], start: int, end: int) -> None:
        """
        A helper function to reverse a sub-array in-place.
        It takes the array and the start and end indices of the sub-array.
        """
        # We use a two-pointer approach to swap elements from the outside in.
        while start < end:
            # Swap the elements at the start and end pointers.
            arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
            # Move the pointers towards the center.
            start += 1
            end -= 1

```

### 6) Followups

An interviewer might ask about other possible solutions or edge cases.

**Follow-up 1: Are there any other ways to solve this with O(1) space?**

Yes, there is another clever method called **Cyclic Replacements**.

*   **Logic:** We can move each element directly to its final position. The element at index `i` moves to `(i + k) % n`. We can start with `nums[0]`, move it to its new position, then take the element that was *at* that new position and move *it* to *its* new position, and so on. We continue this chain until we circle back to our starting index (index 0).
*   **Challenge:** This simple cycle might not cover all elements if `n` and `k` share a common divisor greater than 1 (i.e., `gcd(n, k) > 1`). In that case, we need to start a new cycle from the next unvisited element (e.g., index 1). We repeat this process until all `n` elements have been moved.
*   **Complexity:**
    *   **Time:** O(N), as each element is visited and moved exactly once.
    *   **Space:** O(1), as we only need a few variables to hold the current element and index.
*   **Comparison:** While also optimal, this method is more complex to implement correctly due to the need to handle the cycles, making the reversal algorithm a more common and less error-prone choice in an interview setting.

**Follow-up 2: You already discussed an approach using an extra array. Let's briefly review its pros and cons.**

*   **Approach:** Create a new array `result` of the same size `n`. For each element `nums[i]`, place it in its correct final position in the new array: `result[(i + k) % n] = nums[i]`. Finally, copy the `result` array back into `nums`.
*   **Pros:** Very simple and straightforward logic. Easy to understand and implement.
*   **Cons:** It violates the O(1) space constraint, as it requires O(N) extra space for the new array. For very large arrays, this can be a significant drawback.

**Follow-up 3: How would your solution change if the input was a tuple instead of a list?**

*   Python tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified in-place.
*   Therefore, any in-place algorithm (like reversal or cyclic replacements) is not possible. We would be forced to create a *new* tuple.
*   The most natural solution would be similar to the "extra array" approach. We would build a new list with the rotated elements and then convert that list into a tuple before returning it. The space complexity would necessarily be O(N). The function signature would also change to `def rotate(nums: tuple, k: int) -> tuple:`.
