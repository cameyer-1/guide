### 1) Understanding and Visualization

This problem can be modeled as a directed graph. Each variable (e.g., "a", "b", "c") can be thought of as a node. An equation like `A / B = V` can be represented as a directed edge from node `A` to node `B` with a weight of `V`.

This relationship also implies that `B / A = 1 / V`, so we can represent this as another directed edge from node `B` to node `A` with a weight of `1 / V`.

A query `C / D = ?` is then equivalent to finding the value of a path from node `C` to node `D`. The value of the path is the product of the weights of all edges along the path.

Let's use the first example to visualize this: `equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0]`.

*   `a / b = 2.0` creates a weighted edge `a -> b` with weight `2.0`.
*   It also implies `b / a = 1 / 2.0 = 0.5`, creating an edge `b -> a` with weight `0.5`.
*   `b / c = 3.0` creates a weighted edge `b -> c` with weight `3.0`.
*   It also implies `c / b = 1 / 3.0`, creating an edge `c -> b` with weight `~0.33`.

Here is a diagram of the resulting graph:

```
      (a) --- 2.0 --> (b) --- 3.0 --> (c)
        <-- 0.5 ---       <-- 1/3 ---
```

Now consider the query `a / c = ?`:
To find the value of `a / c`, we need to find a path from node `a` to node `c`.
The path is `a -> b -> c`.
The value is the product of the edge weights along this path: `weight(a -> b) * weight(b -> c) = 2.0 * 3.0 = 6.0`.
This aligns with algebraic substitution: `(a/b) * (b/c) = a/c`.

### 2) Brute Force Approach

The most straightforward way to solve this for each query is to treat it as a pathfinding problem on the graph we've conceptualized. A "brute force" method wouldn't pre-process the equations efficiently. For every single query `(C, D)`, it would repeatedly search through the list of `equations` to find the next step in a path from `C` to `D`.

Let's say we are trying to find `a / c`.
1.  Start at `a`. We need to find an equation involving `a`.
2.  Scan `equations`: we find `a / b = 2.0`.
3.  We are now at `b` with a running product of `2.0`. Our new goal is to find `b / c`.
4.  Scan `equations` again: we find `b / c = 3.0`.
5.  We have reached `c`. The final value is our current running product multiplied by this new value: `2.0 * 3.0 = 6.0`.

This approach is inefficient because we re-scan the `equations` list for every step of our search. If the list of equations is long, this becomes very slow. Furthermore, we need a systematic way to explore all possible paths (like from `a`, we could go to `b`, and from `b` we could go back to `a` or on to `c`) and avoid getting stuck in cycles. This naturally leads to standard graph traversal algorithms like Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS).

### 3) Optimization

The brute-force method's main flaw is its lack of an efficient data structure for looking up relationships. We can significantly improve this by pre-processing the `equations` into an adjacency list representation of the graph. This is a one-time setup cost.

**Data Structure:** We can use a hash map (a dictionary in Python) where keys are the variable names (nodes) and values are lists of their neighbors. Each neighbor will be stored as a tuple containing the neighbor's name and the weight of the edge to it.

`graph = { "a": [("b", 2.0)], "b": [("a", 0.5), ("c", 3.0)], ... }`

**Algorithm:**
Once the graph is built, for each query `(C, D)`, we can perform a graph traversal (like BFS or DFS) starting from node `C` to find node `D`.

1.  **Graph Construction:** Iterate through the `equations` and `values` once. For each equation `A / B = V`, add an edge `A -> B` with weight `V` and an edge `B -> A` with weight `1/V` to our adjacency list.
2.  **Query Processing:** For each query `(C, D)`:
    *   First, check for simple edge cases: If `C` or `D` are not in our graph, no path can exist, so the result is `-1.0`. If `C == D` and `C` is in the graph, the result is `1.0`.
    *   If it's a valid query between existing nodes, start a traversal (we'll use BFS) from `C`.
    *   BFS requires a queue and a set to keep track of visited nodes to avoid infinite loops in cycles. The queue will store tuples of `(current_node, current_product)`.
    *   Start the BFS by adding `(C, 1.0)` to the queue.
    *   While the queue is not empty, dequeue a `(node, product)`. For each of its `(neighbor, weight)`, if the `neighbor` is our target `D`, we've found the path. The answer is `product * weight`.
    *   If a neighbor hasn't been visited, add it to the `visited` set and enqueue it with the updated product: `(neighbor, product * weight)`.
    *   If the BFS completes without finding `D`, it means no path exists, so the answer is `-1.0`.

This approach is far more efficient. The graph construction takes `O(N)` time, where `N` is the number of equations. Each query takes `O(V + E)` time, where `V` is the number of unique variables and `E` is the number of derived relationships (which is `2*N`). The total time complexity is `O(N + Q * (V + E))`, where `Q` is the number of queries.

### 4) Walk-through

Let's walk through the optimized solution with the first example: `equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0], queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]`.

**Step 1: Build Adjacency List**
1.  Initialize `graph = {}`.
2.  Process `("a", "b")` with value `2.0`:
    *   `graph["a"]` gets `("b", 2.0)`.
    *   `graph["b"]` gets `("a", 0.5)`.
3.  Process `("b", "c")` with value `3.0`:
    *   `graph["b"]` gets `("c", 3.0)`.
    *   `graph["c"]` gets `("b", 1/3.0)`.

The final graph is:
`graph = { "a": [("b", 2.0)], "b": [("a", 0.5), ("c", 3.0)], "c": [("b", 0.333...)] }`

**Step 2: Process Queries**
Let `results = []`.

*   **Query 1: `["a", "c"]`**
    1.  `"a"` and `"c"` are in the `graph`.
    2.  Start BFS from `"a"`. `queue = [("a", 1.0)]`, `visited = {"a"}`.
    3.  Dequeue `("a", 1.0)`. Neighbors of `"a"`: `("b", 2.0)`.
    4.  `"b"` is not visited. Enqueue `("b", 1.0 * 2.0) = ("b", 2.0)`. Add `"b"` to `visited`. `queue = [("b", 2.0)]`.
    5.  Dequeue `("b", 2.0)`. Neighbors of `"b"`: `("a", 0.5)` and `("c", 3.0)`.
    6.  `"a"` is visited, skip.
    7.  `"c"` is not visited. Is `"c"` the target? Yes. Path found.
    8.  Result is `current_product * weight = 2.0 * 3.0 = 6.0`.
    9.  Add `6.0` to `results`.

*   **Query 2: `["b", "a"]`**
    1.  `"b"` and `"a"` are in `graph`.
    2.  BFS from `"b"`. `queue = [("b", 1.0)]`, `visited = {"b"}`.
    3.  Dequeue `("b", 1.0)`. Neighbors: `("a", 0.5)`, `("c", 3.0)`.
    4.  `"a"` is not visited. Is `"a"` the target? Yes.
    5.  Result is `1.0 * 0.5 = 0.5`.
    6.  Add `0.5` to `results`.

*   **Query 3: `["a", "e"]`**
    1.  `"a"` is in `graph`, but `"e"` is not. No path possible.
    2.  Result is `-1.0`. Add to `results`.

*   **Query 4: `["a", "a"]`**
    1.  Start node equals end node (`"a"`), and `"a"` is in the graph.
    2.  Result is `1.0`. Add to `results`.

*   **Query 5: `["x", "x"]`**
    1.  Start node `"x"` is not in the graph.
    2.  Result is `-1.0`. Add to `results`.

Final `results` array: `[6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0]`.

### 6) Follow-ups

An interviewer might ask follow-up questions to test the depth of your understanding.

**1. What if the input could contain contradictions? How would you detect them? (e.g., `a/b=2` and `a/b=3`, or a cycle like `a/b=2, b/c=3, c/a=1/5`).**

*   **Answer:** Our current graph-building logic blindly adds edges. To detect a direct contradiction like `a/b=2` followed by `a/b=3`, when adding a new edge, we would have to check if an edge (or its inverse) already exists. If it does, we would check if the new value is consistent with the old one (within a small tolerance for floating-point errors).
*   For cycle contradictions (e.g., `a/b * b/c * c/a` should equal 1), detection is more complex. This suggests that some nodes might belong to the same "equivalency" group. A **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)** data structure is well-suited for this. When processing `a/b = V`, if `a` and `b` are already in the same set, we can check for consistency. If they are in different sets, we `union` them and store the ratio. This would allow detecting contradictions during the graph-building phase.

**2. What are the complexity trade-offs between this BFS/DFS approach and a pre-computation approach like the Floyd-Warshall algorithm?**

*   **Answer:**
    *   **BFS/DFS per query (our solution):**
        *   Time: `O(N + Q * (V + E))`, where `N` is equations, `Q` is queries, `V` is variables, `E` is edges.
        *   Space: `O(V + E)` to store the graph.
        *   This is better when the number of queries `Q` is small or the graph is sparse. It's more flexible if equations can be added dynamically.
    *   **Floyd-Warshall:**
        *   Time: `O(V^3 + N + Q)`. The `O(V^3)` is for pre-computing all-pairs path values.
        *   Space: `O(V^2)` to store the results matrix.
        *   This is better when the number of queries `Q` is very large, making the `O(V^3)` pre-computation cost worthwhile for `O(1)` query lookups afterward. It's suitable for static graphs.
    *   The choice depends on the expected scale of `V` vs. `Q`.

**3. The problem guarantees no division by zero. How would you handle it if a value could be `0`? For instance, `a/b = 0`.**

*   **Answer:** If `a/b = 0`, it implies `a = 0` (assuming `b` is finite and non-zero). This fundamentally changes the problem from ratios to absolute values. The graph model based on multiplicative weights would break down because `b/a` would be `1/0`. A query like `c/a` would be division by zero. To handle this, we'd need to augment our model. We could, for example, run a preliminary pass to identify all variables that must be zero. Any query with a zero-valued variable as the denominator would be invalid (infinity or an error), which we could map to a specific return value as required by the problem specification. The current model, which relies on reciprocals for reverse paths, would not work without modification.
