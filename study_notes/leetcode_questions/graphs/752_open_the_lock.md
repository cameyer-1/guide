### 1) Understanding and Visualization

This problem asks for the minimum number of steps to go from a starting lock combination ("0000") to a `target` combination. We can think of this as a shortest path problem on a graph.

*   **Nodes**: Each of the 10,000 possible combinations (from "0000" to "9999") is a node in our graph.
*   **Edges**: An edge exists between two combinations if you can get from one to the other with a single wheel turn. For example, "1234" is connected to "2234", "0234", "1334", "1134", etc. Each node has exactly 8 neighbors (one turn forward and one backward for each of the 4 wheels).
*   **Deadends**: These are "forbidden" nodes that we cannot visit. We can imagine them as being removed from the graph.
*   **Goal**: Find the length of the shortest path from the "0000" node to the `target` node.

Since we're looking for the *shortest path* in an unweighted graph (each turn/edge costs 1), the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm is the perfect tool.

Let's visualize a simplified 2-wheel lock trying to get from "00" to "12", with a deadend at "01".

```
                (Level 0)     "00"
                              / | \
                             /  |  \
                (Level 1) "10" "90" "09"   ... (and "01", but it's a deadend)
                            |
                            |
                (Level 2) "11" "20" "90" ...
                            |
                            |
                (Level 3) "12" <- Target Found! Path length = 3
```

BFS explores the graph layer by layer, guaranteeing that the first time we reach the `target`, we've done so via the minimum number of steps.

---

### 2) Brute Force Approach

The most direct way to solve this is to implement the BFS strategy described above.

1.  **Initialization**:
    *   Create a queue and add the starting combination `("0000", 0)`, where the second element is the number of turns taken to reach this state.
    *   Create a `visited` set to keep track of combinations we've already processed, to avoid cycles and redundant computations. Add all `deadends` to this `visited` set from the start, as we can't ever land on them.

2.  **BFS Loop**:
    *   While the queue is not empty, dequeue the current combination `(current_code, turns)`.
    *   If `current_code` is the `target`, we've found the shortest path. Return `turns`.
    *   If `current_code` is in our `visited` set, skip it and continue. Otherwise, add it to `visited`.

3.  **Exploration**:
    *   Generate all 8 possible next combinations (neighbors) from the `current_code`.
    *   For each neighbor, if it has not been visited, add it to the queue with an incremented turn count: `(neighbor_code, turns + 1)`.

4.  **Termination**:
    *   If the queue becomes empty and we haven't reached the `target`, it means the `target` is unreachable. Return -1.

This approach is correct and will find the shortest path. However, it can be slow if the `target` is far from "0000", as it explores a progressively larger circle of nodes radiating from a single point.

---

### 3) Optimization

We can significantly speed up the search by using a **Bidirectional BFS**.

Instead of searching only from `start` -> `target`, we will simultaneously search from `start` -> `target` and `target` -> `start`. The search ends when a node from the `start` search is discovered by the `target` search, or vice-versa.

**Why is this faster?**
A standard BFS explores a "search space" of `b^d`, where `b` is the branching factor (8 in our case) and `d` is the distance. A bidirectional BFS runs two searches of depth `d/2`. The total search space becomes `2 * b^(d/2)`. For `d=6`, standard BFS explores `8^6` nodes, while bidirectional BFS explores roughly `2 * 8^3`, which is a massive improvement.

**The Algorithm:**

1.  **Initialization**:
    *   Use two queues: `q_start` for the forward search (from "0000") and `q_target` for the backward search (from `target`).
    *   Use two `visited` dictionaries: `visited_start` and `visited_target`, to store the combination and its distance from its respective origin.
    *   Put `("0000", 0)` in `q_start` and `visited_start`.
    *   Put `(target, 0)` in `q_target` and `visited_target`.
    *   Put all `deadends` in a set for O(1) lookups.

2.  **Search Loop**:
    *   In each iteration of the main loop, we choose to expand the smaller of the two queues. This helps keep the two search frontiers roughly the same size.
    *   Let's say we expand `q_start`. For each `current_code` we generate its neighbors.
    *   For each `neighbor`:
        *   **Check for meeting point**: If `neighbor` is found in `visited_target`, we have found a bridge between the two searches! The total distance is `distance_from_start` + `distance_from_target`. We can return this sum.
        *   **Continue search**: If the neighbor is not a deadend and has not been visited by the `start` search, add it to `q_start` and `visited_start`.

3.  **Termination**:
    *   If either queue becomes empty, it means there's no path connecting the start and target. Return -1.

### 4) Walk-through

Let's trace the optimized solution with the example: `deadends = ["0201", ...], target = "0202"`.

1.  **Initialization**:
    *   `deadends_set = {"0201", "0101", "0102", "1212", "2002"}`
    *   `q_start = [("0000", 0)]`, `visited_start = {"0000": 0}`
    *   `q_target = [("0202", 0)]`, `visited_target = {"0202": 0}`
    *   Check edge case: if `target` ("0202") is a deadend, return -1. It's not.
    *   Check edge case: if "0000" is a deadend, return -1. It's not.

2.  **Level 0**:
    *   `q_start` and `q_target` have the same size. Let's expand `q_start`.
    *   Dequeue `("0000", 0)`.
    *   Neighbors: "1000", "9000", "0100", "0900", etc.
    *   None of these are in `visited_target`. We add them all to `q_start` and `visited_start`.
    *   `q_start` now contains `("1000", 1), ("9000", 1), ...`
    *   `visited_start` now contains `{"0000":0, "1000":1, "9000":1, ...}`

3.  **Level 1**:
    *   `q_target` is now smaller. Let's expand it.
    *   Dequeue `("0202", 0)`.
    *   Neighbors: "1202", "9202", "0302", "0102", ...
    *   Check "0102": It's a deadend. Skip.
    *   Check "1202": Is it in `visited_start`? No. Add `("1202", 1)` to `q_target` and `visited_target`.
    *   Continue for other neighbors. `q_target` now contains `("1202", 1), ...`

This process continues, expanding the smaller queue at each step. Let's fast-forward.

*   `start` search path: `0000` -> `1000` -> `1100` -> `1200` -> `1201` -> `1202` (5 steps)
*   `target` search path: `0202` -> `1202` (1 step)

Eventually, the `start` search will expand from `("1201", 4)`. One of its neighbors will be "1202".

*   Current node being processed: `("1201", 4)` from the `start` search. `current_dist = 4`.
*   Generate neighbor: "1202".
*   Check if "1202" is in `deadends_set`. No.
*   Check if "1202" is in `visited_start`. No.
*   **Check if "1202" is in `visited_target`**. Yes! `visited_target["1202"]` is 1.
*   **Meeting point found!**
*   Total distance = (distance from start to "1201" + 1) + (distance from target to "1202").
*   Total distance = `(4 + 1) + visited_target["1202"]` = `5 + 1` = `6`.
*   Return **6**.

### 5) Implementation

Here is the Python implementation of the Bidirectional BFS solution.

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def openLock(self, deadends: list[str], target: str) -> int:
        
        # --- Helper function to get neighbors ---
        def get_neighbors(code):
            """Generates all 8 neighbors for a given lock code."""
            neighbors = []
            for i in range(4):
                digit = int(code[i])
                
                # Turn forward
                forward_digit = (digit + 1) % 10
                neighbors.append(code[:i] + str(forward_digit) + code[i+1:])
                
                # Turn backward
                backward_digit = (digit - 1 + 10) % 10
                neighbors.append(code[:i] + str(backward_digit) + code[i+1:])
            return neighbors

        # --- Main Logic ---

        # 1. Initialization and Edge Cases
        deadends_set = set(deadends)
        if "0000" in deadends_set:
            return -1
        if target == "0000":
            return 0

        # Queues for bidirectional search
        # We store (code, turns)
        q1 = deque([("0000", 0)])
        q2 = deque([(target, 0)])

        # Visited dictionaries to store (code: turns)
        visited1 = {"0000": 0}
        visited2 = {target: 0}

        # 2. Bidirectional BFS Loop
        while q1 and q2:
            
            # 3. Always expand the smaller queue to keep searches balanced
            if len(q1) <= len(q2):
                current_q, visited_current, visited_other = q1, visited1, visited2
            else:
                current_q, visited_current, visited_other = q2, visited2, visited1
                
            # Process one level of the smaller queue
            # This ensures we are exploring level by level
            level_size = len(current_q)
            for _ in range(level_size):
                code, turns = current_q.popleft()

                # 4. Generate neighbors and check for meeting point
                for neighbor in get_neighbors(code):
                    # Meeting point found
                    if neighbor in visited_other:
                        return turns + 1 + visited_other[neighbor]
                    
                    # If already visited by current search or is a deadend, skip
                    if neighbor in visited_current or neighbor in deadends_set:
                        continue

                    # Otherwise, add to queue and visited set
                    visited_current[neighbor] = turns + 1
                    current_q.append((neighbor, turns + 1))
        
        # 5. If loop finishes, no path was found
        return -1

```
### Code Explanation:
*   **`get_neighbors(code)`**: A helper function to keep the main logic clean. For each of the 4 positions in the `code` string, it calculates the next digit by turning forward (`+1`) and backward (`-1`). The modulo `% 10` handles the wrap-around from '9' to '0' and vice-versa.
*   **`deadends_set = set(deadends)`**: We convert the `deadends` list to a set. This provides O(1) average time complexity for checking if a combination is a deadend, which is much faster than searching a list.
*   **Edge Cases**: We immediately handle the cases where the `start` ("0000") is itself a deadend or the `target` is the `start`.
*   **`q1, q2, visited1, visited2`**: These are the core data structures for our bidirectional search. `q1` and `visited1` handle the search forward from "0000", while `q2` and `visited2` handle the search backward from `target`. The dictionaries store the distance from their respective starting points.
*   **`while q1 and q2`**: The search continues as long as both search frontiers have nodes to explore. If one becomes empty, it means there's no possible path.
*   **`if len(q1) <= len(q2)`**: This is the optimization that makes bidirectional search effective. By always expanding the smaller queue, we keep the two search "circles" roughly the same size, minimizing the total nodes explored.
*   **`level_size` loop**: This loop ensures we process one entire "level" of the smaller queue at a time, which is characteristic of BFS.
*   **`if neighbor in visited_other`**: This is the crucial check. If a neighbor generated from one search (e.g., `q1`) is already in the `visited` set of the *other* search (`visited2`), we've found a meeting point. The total path length is the turns taken so far (`turns + 1`) plus the turns stored in the other visited set (`visited_other[neighbor]`).
*   **`return -1`**: If the `while` loop completes without finding a meeting point, it's impossible to reach the target.

### 6) Follow-ups

**Q1: What if the lock had `N` wheels instead of 4? How would that affect the solution and its complexity?**
*   **A:** The algorithm (Bidirectional BFS) remains the best approach. The changes would be in the implementation and complexity analysis.
    *   **Implementation:** The `get_neighbors` function would need to loop `N` times instead of 4. The state representation (e.g., a string of length N) would also change.
    *   **Complexity:** The number of wheels `N` dramatically affects the size of our graph. With 10 slots per wheel, the number of nodes becomes `10^N`. The branching factor (number of neighbors) becomes `2 * N`.
        *   Standard BFS Complexity: O(Nodes + Edges) = O(10^N + 2*N * 10^N) = O(N * 10^N).
        *   Bidirectional BFS Complexity: Roughly O(N * 10^(N/2)).
    *   The problem becomes exponentially harder as `N` increases. This is known as the curse of dimensionality.

**Q2: Could you have used another algorithm like A\* Search? If so, what would be a good heuristic?**
*   **A:** Yes, A\* search is an excellent alternative for shortest path problems. It's an informed search algorithm that uses a heuristic to guide its search toward the goal, potentially exploring fewer nodes than BFS. A\* uses a priority queue to always expand the node with the lowest `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`, where:
    *   `g(n)` is the actual cost from the start node (the number of turns so far).
    *   `h(n)` is the estimated cost from the current node to the target.
*   **Heuristic (`h(n)`):** For A\* to be optimal, the heuristic must be *admissible* (it never overestimates the true cost). A great heuristic for this problem would be to sum the minimum turns required for each wheel individually, ignoring deadends. This is a "Manhattan Distance" on a circular grid.
    *   For example, to get from "1" to "8" on a single wheel, you can go `1->2->...->8` (7 turns) or `1->0->9->8` (3 turns). The minimum is 3. This can be calculated as `min(abs(d1 - d2), 10 - abs(d1 - d2))`.
    *   So, `h("1234", "8888")` would be `min_turns('1','8') + min_turns('2','8') + ...` = `3 + 4 + 5 + 4 = 16`.
*   **Comparison:** While A\* would likely be more efficient than standard BFS, Bidirectional BFS is often simpler to implement and very effective for problems with a uniform graph structure like this, making it a very strong choice in an interview setting.

**Q3: How would your solution change if some moves were more "expensive" than others? For example, turning a wheel with an even digit costs 1, but turning one with an odd digit costs 2.**
*   **A:** If edge weights are not uniform, BFS no longer guarantees the shortest path. We must use **Dijkstra's algorithm**.
    *   The core change would be to replace the BFS queue with a **priority queue (min-heap)**.
    *   Instead of storing `(code, turns)`, we would store `(total_cost, code)`.
    *   At each step, we would extract the node with the *minimum total cost* from the priority queue.
    *   When exploring neighbors, we would calculate the new cost (`current_cost + move_cost`) and add `(new_cost, neighbor_code)` to the priority queue.
    *   A `visited` set is still crucial, but we'd need to be careful: with Dijkstra's, you only add a node to the visited set after you pull it from the priority queue, not when you first add it. This ensures you always process the shortest path to a node first. Bidirectional search can also be adapted to work with Dijkstra's, but it's more complex to implement correctly.
