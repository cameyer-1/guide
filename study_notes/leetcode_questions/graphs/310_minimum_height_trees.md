### 1) Understanding and Visualization

A "Minimum Height Tree" (MHT) is a tree rooted in such a way that its height is minimized. The height is the longest path from the root to any leaf. Intuitively, we are looking for the "center" of the tree. Nodes on the periphery (leaves) would create very tall trees if chosen as roots, while central nodes would balance the branches, resulting in a shorter overall height.

Let's visualize the problem with Example 2: `n = 6`, `edges = [[3,0],[3,1],[3,2],[3,4],[5,4]]`.

This graph can be drawn as:

```
      0   1   2
       \  |  /
         (3)
          |
         (4)
          |
         (5)
```

-   If we root the tree at node `0`, the longest path is `0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`. The height is 3.
-   If we root the tree at node `3`, the paths are `3->0`, `3->1`, `3->2`, and `3->4->5`. The longest path is `3->4->5`, with a height of 2.
-   If we root the tree at node `4`, the longest path is `4->3` and then to `0`, `1`, or `2`. For instance, `4->3->0`. The height is 2.

By trying all nodes, we'd find that rooting at `3` or `4` gives a minimum height of 2. Therefore, the MHT roots are `[3, 4]`.

The key insight is that MHT roots are the most central nodes. We can find them by iteratively "trimming" the leaves of the tree. The last one or two nodes remaining will be our MHT roots.

### 2) Brute Force Approach

The most straightforward way to solve this is to try every single node as a potential root and calculate the height of the resulting tree. We then keep track of the minimum height found so far and the nodes that produce it.

**Algorithm:**
1.  Initialize `min_height` to infinity and an empty list `results`.
2.  Build an adjacency list representation of the tree from the `edges` input. This allows for efficient traversal.
3.  Iterate through each node `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
    a. For each node `i`, perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from `i` to find the height of the tree if rooted at `i`. A BFS is suitable here as it explores the tree layer by layer. The number of layers is the height.
    b. Let the calculated height be `h`.
    c. Compare `h` with `min_height`:
        i. If `h < min_height`, we have found a new minimum height. Update `min_height = h` and set `results = [i]`.
        ii. If `h == min_height`, we have found another node that results in the same minimum height. Append `i` to `results`.
4.  After iterating through all nodes, `results` will contain the labels of all MHT roots.

**Complexity Analysis:**
-   **Time Complexity:** O(N²). For each of the `N` nodes, we perform a BFS traversal which takes O(N + E) time. Since for a tree, E = N-1, the traversal is O(N). Doing this for all `N` nodes gives O(N * N) = O(N²).
-   **Space Complexity:** O(N) to store the adjacency list.

This approach is too slow for the given constraints (`n` up to 2 * 10⁴), so we must find a more efficient solution.

### 3) Optimization

The brute-force approach is slow because we are re-calculating heights from scratch for every node. The key optimization comes from a topological sorting-like idea. Instead of building the tree up from a root, we can prune it down from its leaves.

The intuition is that the nodes that are furthest from the center are the leaves. If we remove all leaves, the new leaves of the remaining graph are the next set of nodes furthest from the center. We can continue this process layer by layer. The nodes that remain at the very end must be the most central ones—the MHT roots.

**Algorithm:**
1.  Handle the base case: If `n=1`, the only node `0` is the MHT root. Return `[0]`.
2.  Build an adjacency list for the graph and an array or dictionary to store the degree of each node (number of edges connected to it).
3.  Initialize a queue and add all initial leaf nodes (nodes with degree 1) to it.
4.  Start a loop that continues as long as there are more than 2 nodes left in the tree. In each iteration, we will remove the current layer of leaves.
    a. Record the number of leaves currently in the queue. This marks one layer.
    b. Decrement the total number of nodes by the number of leaves we are about to process.
    c. For each leaf in the current layer:
        i. Pop the leaf from the queue.
        ii. For its neighbor, decrement the neighbor's degree.
        iii. If the neighbor's degree becomes 1, it is now a leaf for the next layer. Add it to the queue.
5.  When the loop terminates (i.e., `n <= 2`), the nodes remaining in the queue are the MHT roots. A tree can have one or two MHT roots.

**Complexity Analysis:**
-   **Time Complexity:** O(N). Building the adjacency list and degrees takes O(N + E) = O(N). Each node is added to and removed from the queue exactly once. When we process a node, we visit its neighbors. Since we traverse each edge once, the total time for the pruning process is also O(N + E) = O(N).
-   **Space Complexity:** O(N) to store the adjacency list, degrees, and the queue.

This linear time solution is efficient enough to pass the given constraints.

### 4) Walk-through

Let's walk through the optimized solution with our example: `n = 6`, `edges = [[3,0],[3,1],[3,2],[3,4],[5,4]]`.

**Step 1 & 2: Build Adjacency List and Degrees**
-   `adj = {0:[3], 1:[3], 2:[3], 3:[0,1,2,4], 4:[3,5], 5:[4]}`
-   `degrees = {0:1, 1:1, 2:1, 3:4, 4:2, 5:1}`
-   `remaining_nodes = 6`

**Step 3: Initialize Queue with Leaves**
-   Nodes with degree 1 are `0, 1, 2, 5`.
-   `queue = [0, 1, 2, 5]`

**Step 4: Iterative Pruning**

**Iteration 1:**
-   `remaining_nodes` is 6, which is > 2. The loop begins.
-   Current layer size is `len(queue) = 4`.
-   We will process 4 nodes: `0, 1, 2, 5`.
-   `remaining_nodes` becomes `6 - 4 = 2`.

1.  **Process `0`:**
    -   Pop `0`. Its neighbor is `3`.
    -   Decrement `degrees[3]`: `4 -> 3`. `degrees[3]` is not 1 yet.
2.  **Process `1`:**
    -   Pop `1`. Its neighbor is `3`.
    -   Decrement `degrees[3]`: `3 -> 2`. `degrees[3]` is not 1 yet.
3.  **Process `2`:**
    -   Pop `2`. Its neighbor is `3`.
    -   Decrement `degrees[3]`: `2 -> 1`. Now `degrees[3]` is 1. `3` has become a leaf.
    -   Add `3` to the queue. `queue = [3]`.
4.  **Process `5`:**
    -   Pop `5`. Its neighbor is `4`.
    -   Decrement `degrees[4]`: `2 -> 1`. Now `degrees[4]` is 1. `4` has become a leaf.
    -   Add `4` to the queue. `queue = [3, 4]`.

**End of Iteration 1:**
-   The original leaves are gone. The new leaves are `3` and `4`.
-   `queue = [3, 4]`.
-   `remaining_nodes` is now `2`.

**Step 5: Loop Termination**
-   The condition `remaining_nodes > 2` is now false (2 is not > 2). The loop terminates.
-   The nodes left in the queue are the MHT roots.

**Result:** `[3, 4]`

import collections
from typing import List

    def findMinHeightTrees(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        """
        Finds the root nodes of all Minimum Height Trees (MHTs).
        """
        # Edge case: If there's only one node, it's the only MHT root.
        if n == 1:
            return [0]
            
        # 1. Build the graph representation.
        #    'adj' will be an adjacency list, e.g., adj[i] = [list of neighbors of i].
        #    'degrees' will store the number of edges for each node.
        adj = collections.defaultdict(list)
        degrees = [0] * n
        for u, v in edges:
            adj[u].append(v)
            adj[v].append(u)

        remaining_nodes = n
        while remaining_nodes > 2:
            # The number of leaves in the current layer
            leaves_count = len(queue)
            remaining_nodes -= leaves_count
            
            # Process and remove all leaves in the current layer
            for _ in range(leaves_count):
                leaf = queue.popleft()
                
                # For each neighbor of the removed leaf...
                for neighbor in adj[leaf]:
                    # ...decrement its degree.
                    degrees[neighbor] -= 1
                    # If the neighbor becomes a new leaf, add it to the queue.
                    if degrees[neighbor] == 1:
                        queue.append(neighbor)
        
        # 4. The remaining nodes in the queue are the roots of the MHTs.
        return list(queue)

```

### 6) Follow-ups

An interviewer might ask the following questions to probe deeper understanding:

**1. "Why can there be at most two MHT roots? Why not three or more?"**

*   **Answer:** The roots of MHTs are the center(s) of the tree. A tree's center can be proven to consist of either a single node or two adjacent nodes. This can be understood by considering the longest path in the tree (the diameter). All MHT roots must lie on this path. If the diameter has an odd number of nodes (e.g., A-B-C-D-E), there is one central node (C). If the diameter has an even number of nodes (e.g., A-B-C-D), there are two central nodes (B and C). There is no configuration that results in three or more equidistant centers.

**2. "What happens if the input is not a tree but a general graph with cycles?"**

*   **Answer:** This algorithm fundamentally relies on the properties of a tree. Specifically, a tree with `N > 1` nodes is guaranteed to have at least two leaves (nodes of degree 1). If the graph contains cycles, it might not have any nodes of degree 1 (e.g., a simple triangle graph where all nodes have degree 2). In that case, our initial queue of leaves would be empty, and the algorithm would fail. It would return all nodes of degree 1 if they exist, or an empty list, which would not be the "center" of the graph. For a general graph, defining a "center" is more complex and might require different algorithms like calculating the eccentricity of each node.

**3. "Can you think of another way to solve this, perhaps without the layer-by-layer peeling?"**

*   **Answer:** Yes, another common O(N) approach is to find the diameter of the tree. The diameter is the longest path between any two nodes.
    1.  **Step 1:** Start a BFS/DFS from an arbitrary node `s`. Find the node `x` that is farthest from `s`.
    2.  **Step 2:** Start another BFS/DFS from node `x`. Find the node `y` that is farthest from `x`. The path between `x` and `y` is a diameter of the tree.
    3.  **Step 3:** The center(s) of the tree are the middle one or two nodes on this diameter path. By storing parent pointers during the second BFS/DFS, we can reconstruct the path from `y` back to `x` and find the middle element(s). This approach also has an O(N) time complexity as it involves two full traversals of the tree.

**4. "Can you walk me through the space complexity of your implementation?"**

*   **Answer:**
    *   The adjacency list `adj` stores `2 * (N-1)` entries in total, which is O(N).
    *   The `degrees` list has a size of `N`, which is O(N).
    *   The `queue` in the worst case (a star graph) could hold up to `N-1` nodes. So its space is O(N).
    *   Therefore, the overall space complexity is dominated by these structures, making it O(N).
