### 1. Understanding and Visualization

The problem asks us to find `k` integers in a sorted array `arr` that are the closest to a given value `x`. The result must also be sorted. The "closeness" is defined first by the absolute difference `|a - x|`, and if there's a tie, the smaller number is considered closer.

Let's visualize this with the example: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `k = 4`, `x = 3`.

We can think of the numbers on a number line:

```
<--|----|----|----|----|----|-->
   1    2    3    4    5
             ^
             x
```

Now, let's calculate the distance of each element from `x = 3`:
*   `|1 - 3| = 2`
*   `|2 - 3| = 1`
*   `|3 - 3| = 0`
*   `|4 - 3| = 1`
*   `|5 - 3| = 2`

To find the `k=4` closest elements, we can sort them by their distance to `x`:
1.  `3` (distance 0)
2.  `2` (distance 1)
3.  `4` (distance 1) - Here, `|2-3| == |4-3|`. The tie-breaking rule says the smaller number (`2`) comes first.
4.  `1` (distance 2)
5.  `5` (distance 2) - Similarly, `|1-3| == |5-3|`. `1` comes first as it's smaller.

The sorted list of elements by closeness is `[3, 2, 4, 1, 5]`. Taking the first `k=4` gives us `{3, 2, 4, 1}`. Finally, the problem requires the output to be sorted in ascending order, so we sort this set to get `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.

### 2. Brute Force Approach

The most straightforward way to solve this is to follow the logic from our visualization directly.

**Algorithm:**
1.  Calculate the absolute difference `|num - x|` for every number `num` in the array `arr`.
2.  Sort the original numbers based on these differences. The primary sorting key will be the absolute difference. The secondary sorting key will be the number itself, to handle the tie-breaking rule (`a < b` if `|a-x| == |b-x|`).
3.  Take the first `k` elements from this newly sorted list.
4.  Sort these `k` elements in ascending order to produce the final result.

**Complexity Analysis:**
*   **Time Complexity:** The most expensive step is sorting the entire array of `N` elements based on a custom key. This takes `O(N log N)`. Taking the first `k` elements is `O(k)`, and sorting the final `k` elements is `O(k log k)`. The total time complexity is dominated by the initial sort: `O(N log N + k log k)`.
*   **Space Complexity:** `O(N)` if a new list is created for sorting (common in Python's `sorted()` function), or `O(log N)` to `O(N)` for the space used by the sorting algorithm itself.

This approach is correct but inefficient because it completely ignores the fact that the input array `arr` is already sorted.

### 3. Optimization

We can achieve a much better time complexity by leveraging the sorted property of `arr`. The `k` closest elements will always form a contiguous block (a "window") within the sorted array. The problem then becomes finding the starting point of the best window of size `k`.

Let's say our result is the subarray `arr[i : i+k]`. Our goal is to find the optimal starting index `i`. The possible values for `i` range from `0` to `len(arr) - k`. We can use binary search to find this optimal `i`.

Consider a potential window `arr[mid : mid+k]`. To determine if this is the "best" window, or if we should shift it left or right, we can compare its first element, `arr[mid]`, with the first element that would be included if we shifted the window one position to the right, which is `arr[mid+k]`.

The choice is between two competing windows: `arr[mid : mid+k]` and `arr[mid+1 : mid+k+1]`. These windows only differ by two elements: the first window includes `arr[mid]` and excludes `arr[mid+k]`, while the second excludes `arr[mid]` and includes `arr[mid+k]`.

To decide which window is better, we just need to compare which of `arr[mid]` or `arr[mid+k]` is closer to `x`.
*   If `arr[mid]` is farther from `x` than `arr[mid+k]`, it means we are better off dropping `arr[mid]` and including `arr[mid+k]`. This implies our window is too far to the left, so the optimal starting index must be `mid + 1` or greater.
*   If `arr[mid]` is closer to `x` (or they are equidistant), we should keep `arr[mid]`. This implies that the current window starting at `mid` could be optimal, or the optimal one is even further to the left. We can discard all windows starting to the right of `mid`.

This gives us the logic for a binary search on the starting index of the window.

**Algorithm:**
1.  Define a search space for the starting index of our window. The window has size `k`, so the start can be anywhere from index `0` to `len(arr) - k`. Let's set `low = 0` and `high = len(arr) - k`.
2.  Perform a binary search within this range `[low, high]`.
3.  In each step, calculate `mid`. We then compare the element `arr[mid]` (the first element of the window `arr[mid:mid+k]`) with the element `arr[mid+k]` (the first element outside the window on the right).
4.  The comparison is based on which is farther from `x`: `x - arr[mid]` vs `arr[mid+k] - x`. Note that `x - arr[mid]` can be negative if `x < arr[mid]`, but since `arr[mid] < arr[mid+k]`, this comparison correctly evaluates which element is farther away. If `x` is between them, both are positive. If `x` is outside, one is positive and one is negative.
    *   If `x - arr[mid] > arr[mid+k] - x`, it means `arr[mid]` is farther from `x` than `arr[mid+k]`. Our window is too far left. We need to shift right, so we update `low = mid + 1`.
    *   Otherwise, `arr[mid]` is closer or equidistant. We should keep it. The window `arr[mid:mid+k]` is a better candidate than any to its right. We update `high = mid`.
5.  The loop continues until `low` and `high` converge. The final `low` is the starting index of the optimal window.
6.  Return the subarray `arr[low : low + k]`.

**Complexity Analysis:**
*   **Time Complexity:** `O(log(N-k))` for the binary search, and `O(k)` to create the final subarray slice. Total is `O(log N + k)`.
*   **Space Complexity:** `O(k)` to store the resulting list. If an in-place return was allowed (e.g., returning indices), it would be `O(1)`.

### 4. Walk-through

Let's use the optimized approach on `arr = [1,2,3,4,5]`, `k = 4`, `x = 3`.

**Initialization:**
*   `arr` has length 5, `k=4`.
*   The search space for the starting index is `[0, 5-4]`, which is `[0, 1]`.
*   `low = 0`, `high = 1`.

**Binary Search:**

*   **Iteration 1:**
    *   `low = 0`, `high = 1`. The loop `while low < high:` condition is true.
    *   `mid = 0 + (1 - 0) // 2 = 0`.
    *   We compare `arr[mid]` and `arr[mid+k]`, which are `arr[0]` and `arr[4]`.
    *   These are `1` and `5`.
    *   We check if `x - arr[mid] > arr[mid+k] - x`.
    *   `3 - 1 > 5 - 3`
    *   `2 > 2` -> This is false.
    *   Since the condition is false, it means `arr[mid]` is closer or equidistant. We prefer the window starting at `mid`. We update `high = mid`.
    *   `high` becomes `0`.
*   **End of Loop:**
    *   Now `low = 0` and `high = 0`. The loop condition `low < high` is false, so the loop terminates.

**Result:**
*   The optimal starting index is `low = 0`.
*   We return the slice `arr[low : low+k]`, which is `arr[0 : 0+4]` or `arr[0:4]`.
*   The final output is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. This matches the correct answer.

### 5. Implementation

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
  def findClosestElements(self, arr: List[int], k: int, x: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Finds the k closest elements to x in a sorted array.
    This implementation uses binary search to find the optimal window of size k.
    """
    # The search space is for the starting index of the result subarray.
    # A window of size k can start at any index from 0 to len(arr) - k.
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - k

    # We perform a binary search to find the best starting index 'low'.
    # The loop will converge 'low' and 'high' to the optimal start.
    while low < high:
        # Calculate the middle of the current search range.
        mid = low + (high - low) // 2

        # We are comparing two potential windows:
        # Window 1: arr[mid : mid+k]
        # Window 2: arr[mid+1 : mid+k+1]
        # This decision comes down to comparing the excluded element arr[mid]
        # with the newly included element arr[mid+k].
        #
        # If x is closer to arr[mid+k] than to arr[mid],
        # then the window starting at mid+1 is better.
        # We check this with the condition: x - arr[mid] > arr[mid+k] - x
        # This condition cleverly handles all cases of x's position relative to the elements.
        if x - arr[mid] > arr[mid + k] - x:
            # arr[mid] is "farther" from x than arr[mid+k].
            # This means our window is too far to the left.
            # The best starting index must be at least mid + 1.
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            # arr[mid] is "closer" to x than arr[mid+k], or they are equidistant.
            # In case of a tie, we prefer the smaller element (arr[mid]),
            # which aligns with the problem's tie-breaking rule.
            # The current window starting at 'mid' is a better candidate
            # than any window to its right. So, we shrink our search to the left half.
            high = mid

    # When the loop terminates, 'low' is the starting index of the
    # k closest elements.
    # We return the slice of the array of size k starting at 'low'.
    return arr[low:low + k]

```

### 6. Follow-ups

An interviewer might ask the following questions to test the depth of your understanding.

**Q1: What if the input array `arr` were not sorted?**
*   **A:** If the array is not sorted, we lose the property that allows us to use binary search or sliding windows efficiently.
    1.  **Sort First:** The simplest approach is to first sort the array, which takes `O(N log N)` time. Then, we can apply our optimized `O(log N + k)` solution. The total time complexity would be dominated by the sort, resulting in `O(N log N)`.
    2.  **Heap (Priority Queue):** A more direct approach for an unsorted array is to use a max-heap of size `k`. We iterate through the `N` elements of the array. For each element `num`, we compute its closeness `|num - x|`. We push a tuple `(-|num-x|, -num)` onto the heap (using negative values to simulate a max-heap with Python's min-heap). If the heap's size exceeds `k`, we pop the largest element. This ensures the heap always contains the `k` closest elements seen so far. After iterating through all `N` elements, we extract the elements from the heap and sort them. The time complexity is `O(N log k)` for iterating and heap operations, plus `O(k log k)` for the final sort, giving `O(N log k)`. This is more efficient than `O(N log N)` if `k` is much smaller than `N`.

**Q2: Your comparison `x - arr[mid] > arr[mid+k] - x` looks a bit magical. Can you explain why it correctly handles the tie-breaking rule?**
*   **A:** The tie-breaking rule is: if `|a-x| == |b-x|`, the smaller number `a` is closer. Let's analyze the `==` case in our comparison: `x - arr[mid] == arr[mid+k] - x`. This simplifies to `x = (arr[mid] + arr[mid+k]) / 2`, meaning `x` is exactly halfway between `arr[mid]` and `arr[mid+k]`. In this case, `|x-arr[mid]| == |arr[mid+k]-x|`. Our `if` condition `x - arr[mid] > arr[mid+k] - x` is false, so we execute the `else` block: `high = mid`. By setting `high = mid`, we are essentially saying that the window starting at `mid` (which includes `arr[mid]`) is preferred over the window starting at `mid+1` (which includes `arr[mid+k]`). Since `arr` is sorted, `arr[mid] < arr[mid+k]`. Therefore, our logic correctly prefers the smaller element (`arr[mid]`) in a tie, satisfying the problem's rule.

**Q3: Can you describe an alternative optimized solution?**
*   **A:** Another `O(log N + k)` approach involves a combination of binary search and an expanding window with two pointers.
    1.  **Find Center:** First, use binary search (like Python's `bisect_left`) to find the insertion point for `x` in `arr`. This takes `O(log N)` and gives us an index `right`. Let `left = right - 1`. These two pointers, `left` and `right`, now surround the "ideal" location of `x`.
    2.  **Expand Window:** Initialize an empty result list. For `k` iterations, compare the elements at `arr[left]` and `arr[right]` (handling out-of-bounds cases).
        *   If `arr[left]` is closer to `x` than `arr[right]` (or equally close, honoring the tie-breaker), add `arr[left]` to our collection and move the `left` pointer one step to the left (`left -= 1`).
        *   Otherwise, add `arr[right]` and move the `right` pointer one step to the right (`right += 1`).
    3.  This expansion phase takes `O(k)` time. The resulting collection of `k` elements will be sorted. Using a `collections.deque` is ideal here, as adding to the left (`appendleft`) and right (`append`) are both `O(1)` operations, naturally keeping the list sorted.

Both this expanding window method and the binary search on the window start are excellent, efficient solutions with the same time complexity.
