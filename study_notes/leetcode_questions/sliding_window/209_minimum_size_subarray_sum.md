### 1) Understanding and Visualization

Let's break down the problem using the example `target = 7` and `nums = [2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3]`.

The problem asks for the minimum length of a *contiguous subarray* whose elements sum up to at least the `target`.

A "subarray" is a continuous part of an array. For `nums`, some subarrays are:
*   `[2, 3]` (sum = 5, length = 2)
*   `[1, 2, 4]` (sum = 7, length = 3)
*   `[2, 3, 1, 2]` (sum = 8, length = 4)
*   `[4, 3]` (sum = 7, length = 2)

We are looking for subarrays whose sum is `>= 7`. From the list above, `[1, 2, 4]`, `[2, 3, 1, 2]`, and `[4, 3]` are all valid candidates. Their lengths are 3, 4, and 2, respectively. The goal is to find the *minimal* length among these valid candidates. In this case, the minimal length is 2, from the subarray `[4, 3]`.

Here is a visual representation:

```
nums: [ 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3 ]
        ^--------------^
        Subarray [2,3,1,2] -> Sum = 8 (>= 7), Length = 4. Valid.

nums: [ 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3 ]
              ^--------^
              Subarray [1,2,4] -> Sum = 7 (>= 7), Length = 3. Valid.

nums: [ 2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3 ]
                       ^--^
                       Subarray [4,3] -> Sum = 7 (>= 7), Length = 2. Valid.
```
Comparing the lengths {4, 3, 2}, the minimum is 2. So, the answer is 2.

If no such subarray exists (e.g., `target = 11`, `nums = [1,1,1,1,1]`), we should return 0.

---

### 2) Brute Force Approach

The most straightforward way to solve this is to generate every possible contiguous subarray, calculate its sum, and if the sum meets the target requirement, check if its length is the smallest we've seen so far.

Here is the algorithm:
1.  Initialize a variable `min_length` to a value larger than any possible length, like infinity.
2.  Iterate through the array with a starting pointer `i` from `0` to `n-1` (where `n` is the length of `nums`).
3.  For each `i`, iterate with an ending pointer `j` from `i` to `n-1`. This `(i, j)` pair defines a subarray.
4.  For each subarray `nums[i...j]`, calculate its sum, let's call it `current_sum`.
5.  If `current_sum >= target`, this subarray is a valid candidate. We update `min_length = min(min_length, j - i + 1)`.
6.  After checking all possible subarrays, if `min_length` is still infinity, it means no valid subarray was found; return 0. Otherwise, return `min_length`.

**Complexity Analysis:**
*   A more efficient version of this brute-force approach would avoid re-calculating the sum from scratch for each `j`. We can maintain a running sum for the inner loop.
*   The outer loop runs `n` times.
*   The inner loop runs up to `n` times.
*   This gives a time complexity of **O(n²)**.
*   The space complexity is **O(1)** as we only use a few variables to store pointers and sums.

This O(n²) approach is a valid baseline, but for constraints like `n <= 10^5`, it would be too slow and likely time out.

---

### 3) Optimization

The O(n²) approach is inefficient because it repeatedly calculates sums over overlapping windows. For example, when considering subarrays starting at index 0, we compute the sum of `[2,3]`, then `[2,3,1]`, etc. Then, for subarrays starting at index 1, we compute `[3,1]`, `[3,1,2]`, etc. There is a lot of redundant work.

We can optimize this using the **Sliding Window** technique. This technique is well-suited for problems that ask for something about a contiguous subarray.

The idea is to maintain a "window" (a subarray) that we can expand and shrink. We use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to define the boundaries of this window.

**Algorithm:**
1.  Initialize `left = 0`, `current_sum = 0`, and `min_length = infinity`.
2.  Iterate through the array with the `right` pointer from `0` to `n-1`. In each step, we expand our window to the right:
    *   Add `nums[right]` to `current_sum`.
3.  Now, we have a new window `nums[left...right]`. We check if its sum satisfies the condition:
    *   **While** `current_sum >= target`:
        *   We've found a valid subarray. Update `min_length` with the current window's length: `min_length = min(min_length, right - left + 1)`.
        *   Now, we try to find an even smaller valid window. We shrink the window from the left by subtracting `nums[left]` from `current_sum` and incrementing `left`.
        *   We repeat this check. If the `current_sum` (after shrinking) is still `>= target`, we've found another, even shorter valid window. We update `min_length` again and continue shrinking.
4.  After the `right` pointer has traversed the entire array, the `min_length` will hold the length of the smallest valid subarray. If it's still infinity, no solution was found.

**Why this works:** The `right` pointer ensures we consider all possible ending positions for a subarray. For each `right` position, the `while` loop finds the shortest possible subarray ending at `right` that satisfies the condition. Since `left` only moves forward, each element is visited at most twice (once by `right` and once by `left`). This leads to a linear time complexity.

**Complexity Analysis:**
*   Time Complexity: **O(n)**. Both `right` and `left` pointers traverse the array only once.
*   Space Complexity: **O(1)**. We only need a few variables for the pointers, the current sum, and the result.

### 4) Walk-through

Let's walk through the optimized sliding window solution with our example: `target = 7`, `nums = [2, 3, 1, 2, 4, 3]`.

**Initialization:**
*   `left = 0`
*   `current_sum = 0`
*   `min_length = float('inf')`
*   `n = 6`

**Main Loop (iterating `right` from 0 to 5):**

*   `right = 0`: `num = 2`. `current_sum` becomes 2. `2 < 7`, no `while` loop.
*   `right = 1`: `num = 3`. `current_sum` becomes 2 + 3 = 5. `5 < 7`, no `while` loop.
*   `right = 2`: `num = 1`. `current_sum` becomes 5 + 1 = 6. `6 < 7`, no `while` loop.
*   `right = 3`: `num = 2`. `current_sum` becomes 6 + 2 = 8.
    *   **Condition met**: `current_sum` (8) >= `target` (7). Enter `while` loop.
        *   Window `[2,3,1,2]`, length = `3 - 0 + 1 = 4`.
        *   `min_length = min(inf, 4) = 4`.
        *   Shrink window: `current_sum -= nums[left]` (which is `nums[0]=2`) -> `current_sum` = 6.
        *   Increment `left` to 1.
    *   `while` loop condition `6 >= 7` is now false. Exit `while` loop.
*   `right = 4`: `num = 4`. `current_sum` becomes 6 + 4 = 10.
    *   **Condition met**: `current_sum` (10) >= `target` (7). Enter `while` loop.
        *   Window `[3,1,2,4]`, length = `4 - 1 + 1 = 4`.
        *   `min_length = min(4, 4) = 4`.
        *   Shrink window: `current_sum -= nums[left]` (which is `nums[1]=3`) -> `current_sum` = 7.
        *   Increment `left` to 2.
    *   **Condition still met**: `current_sum` (7) >= `target` (7). Stay in `while` loop.
        *   Window `[1,2,4]`, length = `4 - 2 + 1 = 3`.
        *   `min_length = min(4, 3) = 3`.
        *   Shrink window: `current_sum -= nums[left]` (which is `nums[2]=1`) -> `current_sum` = 6.
        *   Increment `left` to 3.
    *   `while` loop condition `6 >= 7` is now false. Exit `while` loop.
*   `right = 5`: `num = 3`. `current_sum` becomes 6 + 3 = 9.
    *   **Condition met**: `current_sum` (9) >= `target` (7). Enter `while` loop.
        *   Window `[2,4,3]`, length = `5 - 3 + 1 = 3`.
        *   `min_length = min(3, 3) = 3`.
        *   Shrink window: `current_sum -= nums[left]` (which is `nums[3]=2`) -> `current_sum` = 7.
        *   Increment `left` to 4.
    *   **Condition still met**: `current_sum` (7) >= `target` (7). Stay in `while` loop.
        *   Window `[4,3]`, length = `5 - 4 + 1 = 2`.
        *   `min_length = min(3, 2) = 2`.
        *   Shrink window: `current_sum -= nums[left]` (which is `nums[4]=4`) -> `current_sum` = 3.
        *   Increment `left` to 5.
    *   `while` loop condition `3 >= 7` is now false. Exit `while` loop.

**End of Loop:** The `for` loop over `right` is finished. `min_length` is 2. Since `2` is not `inf`, we return 2.

### 5) Implementation

Here is the Python implementation of the optimized O(n) sliding window solution.

```python
import math
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        Finds the minimal length of a contiguous subarray whose sum is >= target.
        
        Uses the sliding window technique for O(n) time complexity.
        """
        
        # 1. Initialize variables
        # `n` stores the length of the input array.
        n = len(nums)
        
        # `min_len` will store the result. We initialize it to a value
        # larger than any possible length (infinity) to handle cases where
        # no valid subarray is found.
        min_len = math.inf
        
        # `left` pointer for the start of the window, initialized to the beginning.
        left = 0

        current_sum = 0
        
        # 2. Iterate through the array with the `right` pointer to expand the window.
        for right in range(n):
            # Add the current element to the window's sum.

            # If so, shrink the window from the left until it's no longer valid,
            # updating min_len each time.
            while current_sum >= target:
                # We have a valid window from `left` to `right`.
                # Calculate its length.
                current_len = right - left + 1
                
                # Update the overall minimum length.
                min_len = min(min_len, current_len)
                
                # Shrink the window from the left by removing the `left`-most element
                # and advancing the `left` pointer.
                current_sum -= nums[left]
                left += 1
                
        # 4. Return the result.
        # If `min_len` is still infinity, it means no valid subarray was found.
        # In this case, the problem asks for 0. Otherwise, return the found length.
        return min_len if min_len != math.inf else 0

```

### 6) Follow-ups

#### Follow-up 1: "If you have figured out the O(n) solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is O(n log(n))."

An O(n log n) complexity often suggests an approach involving binary search. But what can we binary search on? We can binary search on the **answer** itself: the subarray length.

The possible lengths of a subarray range from 1 to `n`. Let's say we want to check if a valid subarray of length `k` exists.
*   If a subarray of length `k` with `sum >= target` exists, then a subarray of length `k+1` with `sum >= target` is also likely to exist (since numbers are positive).
*   If no subarray of length `k` with `sum >= target` exists, then no subarray of length `k-1` will exist either.

This monotonic property allows us to binary search for the minimum possible length `k`.

**Algorithm:**
1.  Binary search for the length `k` in the range `[1, n]`.
2.  For each `k`, we need a helper function, let's call it `check(k)`, that returns `True` if a subarray of size `k` exists with a sum `>= target`, and `False` otherwise.
3.  The binary search logic:
    *   If `check(k)` is `True`, it means a solution of length `k` is possible. We should try for an even smaller length. So, we store `k` as a potential answer and search in the lower half: `high = k - 1`.
    *   If `check(k)` is `False`, a length of `k` is not sufficient. We need to try larger lengths. So, we search in the upper half: `low = k + 1`.

**How to implement `check(k)` in O(n) time?**
We can check for a fixed-size window of length `k` using a sliding window approach.

1.  Calculate the sum of the first `k` elements.
2.  If this sum is `>= target`, return `True`.
3.  Iterate from index `k` to `n-1`. In each step, slide the window by one position: subtract the element that is leaving the window and add the new element that is entering.
4.  If the window sum is ever `>= target`, return `True`.
5.  If we finish the loop without finding such a window, return `False`.

This `check(k)` function takes O(n) time. Since the binary search performs O(log n) calls to `check(k)`, the total time complexity is **O(n log n)**. The space complexity is **O(1)**.

**Implementation for O(n log n):**
```python
class Solution:
    def minSubArrayLen_nlogn(self, target: int, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        
        def check(k: int) -> bool:
            """Checks if any subarray of size k has a sum >= target."""
            if k == 0:
                return False
            # Calculate sum of the first window
            current_sum = sum(nums[:k])
            if current_sum >= target:
                return True
            
            # Slide the window across the rest of the array
            for i in range(k, n):
                current_sum = current_sum - nums[i - k] + nums[i]
                if current_sum >= target:
                    return True
            return False

        min_len = 0
        low, high = 1, n
        
        while low <= high:
            mid = (low + high) // 2
            if check(mid):
                # A subarray of this length works, try for a smaller one
                min_len = mid
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                # This length is too small, need a larger one
                low = mid + 1
                
        return min_len
```

#### Follow-up 2: "What if the numbers in the array could be negative?"

If the numbers could be negative, the O(n) sliding window approach would fail. The core assumption of that algorithm is that expanding the window (adding an element) *cannot* decrease the sum (since all numbers are positive). This assumption guarantees that once `current_sum >= target`, any further expansion of the window to the right will not make it "more optimal" in terms of length. Similarly, when we shrink from the left, the sum decreases, forcing us to expand again.

With negative numbers, this logic breaks. Shrinking the window from the left by removing a negative number would *increase* the sum, potentially making a previously invalid window valid. The monotonic behavior of the `current_sum` is lost.

**How to solve it with negative numbers?**
A common approach involves using **prefix sums**. Let `prefix[i]` be the sum of `nums[0...i-1]`. The sum of a subarray `nums[i...j]` is `prefix[j+1] - prefix[i]`.

We want to find indices `i < j` that minimize `j - i`, subject to the condition `prefix[j+1] - prefix[i] >= target`.

This can be rewritten as `prefix[i] <= prefix[j+1] - target`.

For each `j`, we need to find an `i < j` that satisfies this condition and maximizes `i` (to minimize `j - i`). This becomes a more complex problem. A standard O(n) solution for this variant (like LeetCode 862. Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K) uses a **monotonic deque** to efficiently find the optimal `i` for each `j`. The O(n²) brute-force approach, however, would still work correctly, as would the `prefix sum` based O(n^2) approach.
