### **Chapter 2: Back-of-the-Envelope Math: From Vague to Quantifiable**

After establishing the functional and non-functional requirements, the system remains a collection of abstract goals. To transition from a philosopher to an architect, you must translate these goals into numbers. This is the purpose of back-of-the-envelope calculations.

This exercise is not about achieving perfect numerical accuracy. The interviewer does not expect you to know the exact number of daily active users for Twitter or the average size of a Netflix video segment. They expect you to demonstrate an ability to reason with orders of magnitude. The goal is to determine if you're building a system that needs to handle 10 requests per second or 100,000. The architecture required for these two scales is fundamentally different. This step grounds your design in reality and forces you to identify the most critical bottlenecks before you've drawn a single box.

### **2.1 Estimating Users, Traffic (QPS), Data, and Bandwidth**

The estimation process is a funnel. You start with the broadest number (the user base) and progressively refine it into specific technical specifications (QPS, storage, bandwidth). Always state your assumptions clearly and use simple, round numbers that are easy to manipulate.

#### **The Estimation Funnel**

**Step 1: The User Base**
Start by estimating the number of users. If the interviewer doesn't provide a number, propose a reasonable one for a large-scale application. A good default is **100 Million Monthly Active Users (MAU)** or **10 Million Daily Active Users (DAU)**. The DAU is often more useful for calculating request loads.

**Step 2: User Behavior & Core Actions**
Consult your list of Functional Requirements. For each core feature, estimate how often an average user performs that action. Critically, separate read actions (viewing data) from write actions (creating or changing data).

**Step 3: Calculating Traffic (QPS)**
Translate user actions into Queries Per Second (QPS), the lifeblood of system capacity planning.

*   **Average QPS:** The formula is: `(Total Daily Actions) / (24 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds)`.
*   **Peak QPS:** Traffic is never uniform. It has daily peaks and troughs. A robust system must be designed for its peak load. A common rule of thumb is to assume **Peak QPS is 2x to 5x of the Average QPS**. Always state your chosen multiplier.

**Step 4: Estimating Storage**
Calculate how much data you will need to store over time.

*   For each write action, estimate the size of a single record. Add up the sizes of the various IDs, timestamps, strings, and other fields.
*   `Daily Storage Growth = (Number of Writes per Day) * (Size of a Single Record)`
*   Extrapolate this to yearly growth and for a multi-year horizon (e.g., 5 years) to understand the long-term storage requirements.

**Step 5: Estimating Bandwidth**
Calculate the amount of data entering (ingress) and leaving (egress) your system.

*   `Bandwidth (ingress/egress) = QPS * (Average size of request/response payload)`

#### **Illustrative Example: "Ride-Sharing App" Calculations**

Let's apply this funnel to our previously scoped V1 ride-sharing app.

**1. Assumptions:**
*   **Users:** 10 Million DAU.
*   **Active Drivers:** Let's assume 10% of DAU are drivers, so 1 Million drivers total. At any given time during peak hours, let's say 20% of them are online. So, **200,000 concurrent online drivers**.
*   **Active Riders:** At any given time during peak hours, let's say 20% of DAU are active. So, **2 Million concurrent online riders**.
*   **Peak/Average Ratio:** We'll assume a peak load of **3x** the average.

**2. Workload Estimation (QPS):**

*   **Driver Location Update (WRITE):** This is likely our heaviest write load.
    *   Assumption: An online driver's app sends a location update every 4 seconds.
    *   `Average Write QPS = 200,000 drivers / 4s = 50,000 QPS`
    *   `Peak Write QPS = 50,000 * 3 = 150,000 QPS`

*   **Rider Watching Nearby Drivers (READ):** This is likely our heaviest read load.
    *   Assumption: An active rider's app fetches nearby driver data every 10 seconds.
    *   `Average Read QPS = 2,000,000 riders / 10s = 200,000 QPS`
    *   `Peak Read QPS = 200,000 * 3 = 600,000 QPS`

*   **Architectural Insight:** The **Read/Write Ratio** is `600k / 150k = 4:1`. The system is read-heavy. This immediately tells us that caching strategies and read-replica databases will be critical architectural patterns.

**3. Storage Estimation:**

*   We only need to store completed rides for V1.
*   Assumption: On average, 1 ride per DAU per day. `10 Million rides/day`.
*   Assumption: A single ride record contains `ride_id`, `rider_id`, `driver_id`, `start_loc`, `end_loc`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `price`, `rating`. Let's estimate this at **1 KB per record**.
*   `Daily Storage Growth = 10,000,000 records * 1 KB/record = 10 GB/day`
*   `Yearly Storage Growth = 10 GB/day * 365 days = ~3.65 TB/year`
*   **Architectural Insight:** The storage requirement for the core ride data is not extreme. We won't need a petabyte-scale solution for V1. However, we must ensure the chosen database can handle the **write QPS** of new ride records being created.

**4. Bandwidth Estimation:**

*   **Ingress (Driver uploads):**
    *   `150,000 QPS * (let's say 256 bytes per update) = ~38 MB/s`

*   **Egress (Rider downloads):**
    *   The payload here is larger as it contains a list of drivers. Let's assume 2 KB per response.
    *   `600,000 QPS * 2 KB = ~1.2 GB/s`

*   **Architectural Insight:** The egress bandwidth is significant (`~1.2 GB/s` is roughly `10 Gbps`). This cost will be substantial and pushes us to think about optimizations like geo-partitioning and efficient data serialization formats (e.g., Protocol Buffers over JSON).

By spending a few minutes on these calculations, we have moved from a vague idea to a set of hard constraints. We now know we need a system that can handle **600,000 peak reads/sec**, **150,000 peak writes/sec**, ingest a few terabytes of data a year, and serve over **1 GB/s** of data. These numbers will be your guideposts for every subsequent decision.

### **2.2 The 80/20 Rule: Identifying the Read-Heavy vs. Write-Heavy Workloads**

After calculating the raw traffic numbers, the next step is to interpret them. One of the most important interpretations is determining the fundamental character of your system's workload. The Pareto principle, or the 80/20 rule, often applies here: a small fraction of your system's features (20%) will typically account for the vast majority of its traffic (80%). More importantly, within that traffic, there is almost always a significant imbalance between read operations (retrieving data) and write operations (creating or modifying data).

Identifying this read/write imbalance is a pivotal moment in the interview. It is a simple diagnostic that has profound implications for the entire architecture. A system designed to serve reads looks radically different from one designed to absorb writes. Choosing the wrong optimization path leads to systems that are slow, expensive, and difficult to scale.

#### **Why This Distinction is Critical**

Think of reads and writes as having different engineering "needs."

*   **Read-Heavy Systems** are defined by users consuming content far more often than they create it. The primary engineering goal is to make this consumption as fast and cheap as possible. The architecture will naturally favor:
    *   **Aggressive Caching:** Multi-layered caches (in-memory, distributed like Redis) become the centerpiece of the architecture.
    *   **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):** For serving static and semi-static content from edge locations close to the user.
    *   **Read Replicas:** Using database replication to create multiple copies of the data that can serve read queries in parallel, taking the load off the primary database.
    *   **Data Denormalization:** Deliberately duplicating data and pre-joining tables to optimize for common read patterns, even at the cost of more complex write logic.

*   **Write-Heavy Systems** are defined by high-volume data ingestion. The primary engineering goal is to capture, process, and durably store incoming data without dropping anything. The architecture will naturally favor:
    *   **Ingestion Queues & Logs:** Using a message queue (like RabbitMQ) or a commit log (like Apache Kafka) as a highly available, durable front door to buffer the incoming write traffic.
    *   **Write-Optimized Databases:** Choosing databases designed for high write throughput, such as wide-column stores (Cassandra) or Log-Structured Merge-Tree (LSM-Tree) based systems.
    *   **Horizontal Partitioning (Sharding):** Distributing the write load for a single table across many different servers.
    *   **Asynchronous Processing:** Deferring non-critical work (like generating thumbnails or sending notifications) to background workers to keep the critical write path as fast as possible.

#### **How to Perform the Analysis**

Using the numbers you calculated in the previous step, create a simple balance sheet of your system's primary operations.

Let's revisit our "Ride-Sharing App" example:

| Core Action                  | Type  | Peak QPS Estimate | Dominant Characteristic                                       |
| ---------------------------- | :---: | :---------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Driver Location Update       | **WRITE** |      150,000      | High-volume, constant stream. A classic write-heavy workload. |
| Rider Watches Nearby Drivers | **READ**  |      600,000      | Extremely high-volume reads of frequently changing data.      |
| Request a Ride               | **WRITE** |      ~50-100      | Low QPS but transactionally critical.                         |
| View Ride History            | **READ**  |      ~1,000       | Infrequent reads of historical (mostly immutable) data.       |
| **Total Read QPS**           |       |    **~601,000**     |                                                               |
| **Total Write QPS**          |       |    **~150,100**     |                                                               |

**Conclusion and Statement of Intent:**
After laying this out, you can make a definitive statement:

*"Looking at the numbers, the system has a peak read-to-write ratio of roughly 600,000 to 150,000, which is **4:1**. Therefore, this is a **read-heavy system**. While we have a significant write load from driver location updates that must be handled gracefully, the dominant performance bottleneck and area for optimization will be serving the massive number of read requests from riders. Consequently, my design will heavily prioritize a multi-layered caching strategy and an optimized read path to serve nearby driver data efficiently."*

#### **Contrasting Example: IoT Sensor Data Ingestion**

Imagine the prompt was "Design a system to collect temperature data from 10 million IoT devices."

| Core Action         | Type  | Peak QPS Estimate  | Dominant Characteristic                             |
| ------------------- | :---: | :----------------: | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Sensor Data Point   | **WRITE** |     1,000,000      | Massive, unrelenting firehose of write traffic.    |
| Analyst Runs Query  | **READ**  |         <1         | Infrequent, complex analytical queries.             |
| **Total Read QPS**  |       |        **<1**        |                                                     |
| **Total Write QPS** |       |    **1,000,000**     |                                                     |

**Conclusion:** The read/write ratio is practically zero. This is an unequivocally **write-heavy** system. Your entire design discussion would now revolve around Kafka for ingestion, Cassandra or TimescaleDB for write-optimized storage, and an analytics engine like Spark or Druid for the rare, heavy reads. Caching would be an irrelevant distraction.

This simple analysis is your compass. It sets the direction for the rest of the interview and ensures that every component you propose serves the primary goal dictated by the system's fundamental workload character.

### **2.3 Using Your Numbers to Justify Scale**

The numbers you have just calculated are not an academic sidebar; they are the bedrock upon which your entire technical argument will be built. Their purpose is to provide an objective, data-driven rationale for the architectural decisions you are about to make. In an interview setting, this is how you transition from making suggestions to stating conclusions. You move from saying "I think we should use a distributed database" to "The calculated peak write QPS of 150,000 *requires* us to use a distributed database."

This section is about wielding those numbers to justify why a simple architecture is insufficient and why a more complex, scalable system is not a premature optimization but a day-one necessity.

#### **From Numbers to Architectural Mandates**

The core technique is to compare your calculated load against the generally accepted limits of single-machine components. By showing that your load vastly exceeds these limits, you logically prove the need for a distributed approach.

**Justifying a Fleet of Application Servers**

This is typically the most straightforward justification. A single application server, even a powerful one, can handle a finite number of requests per second, perhaps in the low thousands (1k-2k QPS) for a moderately complex operation.

*   **Your Justification:** *"Our peak read QPS is 600,000. A single application server cannot possibly handle this load. Therefore, a foundational component of our architecture must be a load balancer distributing traffic across a large, auto-scaling fleet of stateless application servers."*

**Justifying a Distributed Database for Writes**

This is one of the most critical justifications, as it often dictates your choice of database technology. A high-end, vertically scaled relational database (like PostgreSQL or MySQL on the largest available cloud instance) can handle a few thousand transactional write QPS, perhaps up to 5,000 QPS under ideal conditions.

*   **Your Justification:** *"Our calculation for the driver location updates resulted in a peak write load of **150,000 QPS**. This number is more than an order of magnitude greater than what the best monolithic relational database can handle. This single number proves that using a single RDBMS is not a viable option. We are forced from the outset to choose a database system that can scale writes horizontally. This leads us directly to systems like Apache Cassandra or a sharded RDBMS like Vitess."*

**Justifying an Aggressive Caching Layer for Reads**

The same logic applies to reads, but the solution set is different. While read replicas can help scale reads, even they can be overwhelmed by extreme traffic.

*   **Your Justification:** *"The system must handle a peak read load of **600,000 QPS**, primarily from riders checking for nearby drivers. While we can use read replicas to offload some of this, serving this volume directly from any database would be prohibitively expensive and would introduce latency. The sheer magnitude of this number justifies the implementation of a dedicated, in-memory caching layer using a system like Redis or Memcached. The primary goal of this cache will be to absorb the vast majority of these reads, protecting our core database and providing sub-millisecond responses to the user."*

**Justifying a Dedicated Object Store for "Big Data"**

While our ride-sharing app's storage needs were measured in terabytes per year, other systems are not so fortunate. This is where you justify the need for "blob" storage.

*   **Hypothetical Justification:** *"If we were to add a feature for drivers to upload dashcam footage for insurance purposes, the numbers would change dramatically. A 5-minute video could be 100 MB. If 10,000 such videos are uploaded daily, our daily storage growth would be `10,000 * 100 MB = 1 TB/day`, or **365 TB/year**. Storing petabytes of unstructured binary data directly in a traditional database is inefficient and unscalable. These numbers justify using a dedicated object store like Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage. Our database would then only store the metadata and a pointer to the object in S3, not the object itself."*

#### **The Power of Proof**

Notice the pattern in each justification.
1.  **State the calculated load:** "The system requires X."
2.  **State the known limit of a simple solution:** "A single machine can only handle Y."
3.  **State the conclusion:** "Because X >> Y, we are required to use solution Z."

By using your numbers as evidence, you are no longer just sharing an opinion. You are presenting a logical proof. You demonstrate an engineer's pragmatism: you would prefer a simpler solution if it were viable, but the data proves it is not. This evidence-based approach to justifying complexity is a hallmark of a senior engineer and a powerful tool for acing the system design interview.
